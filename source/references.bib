An entirely new representation of the design-minimally a set of twelve lines, six for each of the two overlapping squares-is needed if the rule is to apply appropriately. Using this new representation, the rule applies to the central square and this time produces the correct result; but it no longer applies to either of the two overlapping~{\ldots}

CAD/CAM technologies opened up new opportunities by allowing design and production of complex geometric shapes. One of the first applications of computational process in architecture was based on using shape grammars, a rule-based expert systems in artificial intelligence generating geometric shapes. Early applications of shape grammars in art and architecture started shortly after its invention during the 70ies~{\ldots}

abstract = {This report outlines the current focus of the research at the Key Centre of Design Computing (KCDC) in the field of knowledge-based design and its future directions. The research is classified into seven main areas as follows: {\&} {\#}x02022; Computer-Supported Synchronous Collaborative Design (CSSCD) {\&} {\#}x02022; Design Creativity {\&} {\#}x02022; Evolutionary Models of Design {\&} {\#}x02022; Shape Emergence {\&} {\#}x02022; Design Intent and Multiple Abstractions {\&} {\#}x02022; Integration of Specific and General Knowledge {\&} {\#}x02022; Concept Learning - Machine Learning. While each such area will be discussed separately, there are many interrelations between them. For example, the research on CSSCD includes the research into shape emergence, design intent and multiple abstractions and their integration in the one environment; design creativity includes research into shape emergence and evolutionary models; CSSCD, evolutionary models, design creativity, case-based design and design intent/multiple abstractions all deal with object-oriented or schema-based representations of design objects and classes, using the design prototype schema developed at the then Design Computing Unit (DCU). The work on memory organization for heterogenous design knowledge includes aspects of concept learning and machine learning. Evolutionary models are also seen as an approach to machine learning. All the above areas of research are concerned with producing computable models of design processes based on integrating artificial intelligence approaches with CAD systems to provide better design support for designers using CAD systems. Other areas of research of the KCDC, not described in this paper are design theory and practice. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {This paper describes research carried out to develop a parametric urban shape grammar for the Zaouiat Lakhdar quarter of the Medina of Marrakech in Morocco. The goal is to create the basis for a system that could capture some features of the existing urban fabric and apply them in contemporary urban planning and architectural design. The methodology used is described, from the initial historical analysis and fieldwork to the identification of three subgrammars necessary to encode the complexity of the urban preexistences: the urban grammar, the negotiation grammar, and the housing grammar. Topdown and bottom-up approaches to grammar design are analyzed and compared. The bottom-up urban grammar developed is then described, and a hand derivation of the existing urban fabric is proposed. Visual, symbolic, and tagged computer implementations of shape grammars are briefly discussed and a novel design generated by the tagged interpreter is presented.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University. This article presents the 'Roman City Ruleset', a suite of procedural rules for creating 3D models of Roman and Hellenistic architecture and urban environments. Unlike traditional 3D modeling software, in which the user directly manipulates polygons to simulate form, procedural modeling entails the use of computer programming languages to write a semantic description of a building that then generates a polygonal model. Procedural modeling has the potential to address a number of issues related to 3D archaeological reconstructions which are of concern to digital humanists. Of particular interest for archaeologists and architectural historians is the ability to test hypothetical reconstructions of ancient architecture in a fully realized urban context. The procedural rules link each iteration of a model to its source material, allowing the degree of certainty present in each model to be accurately defined through the documentation of each step in the process of interpreting a given data set. Procedural modeling enhances the scholarly value of architectural reconstructions by providing a platform for the comparison and refutation of 3D visualizations, and advances the methodology of 3D modeling toward becoming an essential part of the digital humanist's toolkit.},

abstract = {The Logic of Architecture is the first comprehensive, systematic, and modern treatment of the logical foundations of design thinking. It provides a detailed discussion of languages of architectural form, their specification by means of formal grammars, their interpretation, and their role in structuring design thinking.Supplemented by more than 200 original illustrations, The Logic of Architecture reexamines central issues of design theory in the light of recent advances in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and the theory of computation. The richness of this approach permits sympathetic and constructive analysis of positions developed by a wide range of theorists and philosophers from Socrates to the present.Mitchell first considers how buildings may be described in words and shows how such descriptions may be formalized by the notation of first order predicate calculus. This leads to the idea of a critical language for speaking about the qualities of buildings. Turning to the question of representation by drawings and scale models, Mitchell then develops the notion of design worlds that provide graphic tokens which can be manipulated according to certain grammatical rules. In particular, he shows how domains of graphic compositions possible in a design world may be specified by formal shape grammars. Design worlds and critical languages are connected by showing how such languages may be interpreted in design worlds. Design processes are then viewed as computations in a design world with the objective of satisfying predicates of form and function stated in a critical language.William J. Mitchell is G. Ware and Edythe M. Travelstead Professor of Architecture at Harvard University and a founder of the Computer Aided Design Group in Los Angeles. Among the books he has authored or coauthored are The Poetics of Gardens, The Art of Computer Graphics Programming, and Computer Aided Architectural Design.},

Shape grammars are the formalism proposed to systematize the design rules required for such a system. A shape grammar for Alvaro Siza's patio houses at Malagueira, a 1200-unit development still being designed and constructed today, is presented. The grammar is based on the corpus of thirty-five houses designed between 1977 and 1996. The generation of houses in the grammar proceeds by the recursive dissection of rectangles locating four different functional zones (patio, living, services, and sleeping) and the key placement of the staircase. The schematic generations of two existing houses and the detailed generation of a novel one illustrate the grammar.},

abstract = {The goal of the research described in this paper is to develop a computational model of the Medina of Marrakech in Morocco. The ultimate goal is to develop a system that could capture some of the characteristics of traditional Muslim cities fabric and use it in contemporary urban planning. Previous papers have proposed the use of three grammars to encode the spatial complexity of the Medina: the urban grammar, the negotiation grammar, and the housing grammar, and addressed the development of the urban grammar. This paper proposes a grammar to describe the formal structure of the houses, the first step in the developments of the remaining two grammars. It describes the set of rules and then illustrates its application in the generation of an existing house. The basic formal structure consists of three concentric rectangular rings with the patio in the middle. The location of the entrance and the staircase are fundamental for the definition of the basic layout.},

Support for earlier stages of product development, when both the structure and shape of the design are still fluid, demands conceptual design tools that support designers' ways of thinking and working, and enhance creativity, for example, by offering design alternatives, difficult or not, possible without the use of such tools. The potential of spatial grammars as a technology to support such design tools has been demonstrated through experimental research prototypes since the 1970s. In this paper, we provide a review of recent spatial grammar implementations, which were presented in the Design Computing and Cognition 2010 workshop on which this paper is based, in the light of requirements for conceptual design tools and identify future research directions in both research and design education.</p></div>},

abstract = {There are building systems, called "modularized", in which the component systems (for structure, lighting, etc) can be analyzed and synthesized independently since their performance and design do not interact or affect one another. There are other building systems, called "coupled", in which the component systems do interact and influence one another. The thesis acknowledges that in a building there are both sub-systems that act independently and others that interact. While many design processes have been proposed for dealing with discrete sub-systems, there is no systematic study for building sub-systems that interrelate. This thesis examines a different design approach called integrated. The term "integrated" has a dual utilization in this study. The first use refers to the integration of form and building performance. The second use refers to the integration of interrelated and diverse building performances involving multiple disciplines. The integrated design approach analyzes and evaluates several interrelated design systems involving different disciplines in the early design phase. The goal of the approach is the generation of design alternatives guided simultaneously by two basic objectives: the aspiration for form exploration and the satisfaction of the performances of interrelated systems. After defining a framework for an integrated design approach, which includes inter-disciplinary collaboration, unified design, optimization, simulation, and other formal and digital techniques, the approach will be demonstrated in a case study. The objective of the case study is to demonstrate that the integrated design approach has validity and can be realized, in this case, for the generation of high-rise buildings guided by structural, lighting, zoning codes, and aesthetic criteria.},

The establishment of a fireplace is the key to the definition of the prairie-style house. Around this fireplace, functionally distinguished Froebelean-type blocks are recursively added and interpenetrated to form the basic compositions from which elaborated prairie-style houses are derived.The grammar is based on a corpus of eleven houses from the Winslow house, the evolutionary precursor of the style, to the Robie house, considered by many as the culmination of the style.Much has been written about prairie-style houses{\textemdash}their balance, their debt to Beaux Arts and Japanese design traditions, and their organic qualities. However, such descriptions do not explicitly inform us as to how prairie-style houses are constructed, and consequently provide little help in designing new members of this style.

In this report, we survey some of the shape grammar papers, present some projects using shape grammars, and give our evaluation of shape grammars in computer graphics. In particular, we feel shape grammars are useful for generating a large variety of buildings, such as might be needed in computer games or animations, and that they could also be useful in design for exploring a large number of similar variations~{\ldots}

It starts with some introductory examples in the first learning unit to motivate the main idea: to describe a shape using an algorithm. After the explanation of technical terms, the second unit focuses on technical details of algorithm descriptions, programming languages, grammars and compiler construction, which play an important role in generative modeling. The purely geometric aspects are covered by the third learning unit. It comprehends the~{\ldots}

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Cambridge University Press. The ability to work with ambiguity and compute new designs based on both defined and emergent shapes are unique advantages of shape grammars. Realizing these benefits in design practice requires the implementation of general purpose shape grammar interpreters that support: (a) the detection of arbitrary subshapes in arbitrary shapes and (b) the application of shape rules that use these subshapes to create new shapes. The complexity of currently available interpreters results from their combination of shape computation (for subshape detection and the application of rules) with computational geometry (for the geometric operations need to generate new shapes). This paper proposes a shape grammar implementation method for three-dimensional circular arcs represented as rational quadratic B{\'e}zier curves based on lattice theory that reduces this complexity by separating steps in a shape computation process from the geometrical operations associated with specific grammars and shapes. The method is demonstrated through application to two well-known shape grammars: Stiny's triangles grammar and Jowers and Earl's trefoil grammar. A prototype computer implementation of an interpreter kernel has been built and its application to both grammars is presented. The use of B{\'e}zier curves in three dimensions opens the possibility to extend shape grammar implementations to cover the wider range of applications that are needed before practical implementations for use in real life product design and development processes become feasible.},

The idea of generative modeling is to allow the generation of highly complex objects based on a set of formal construction rules. Using these construction rules, a shape is described by a sequence of processing steps, rather than just by the result of all applied operations: Shape design becomes rule design. Due to its very general nature, this approach can be applied to any domain and to any shape representation that provides a set of generating functions. The aim of this report is to give an overview of the concepts and techniques of procedural and generative modeling as well as their applications with a special focus on Archaeology and Architecture.},

The goal of this article is to describe and discuss how the designer's knowledge was encoded into shape rules. The process used to extract the architect's knowledge and to incorporate it into the transformation grammar enable us to abstract the designer's actions and to define a sequence of actions that can define a possible strategy of design.

abstract = {This is a partial theory of thinking, combining a number of classical and modern concepts from psychology, linguistics, and AI. Whenever one encounters a new situation (or makes a substantial change in one's viewpoint) he selects from memory a structure called a frame, a remembered framework to be adopted to fit reality by changing details as necessary. A frame is a data-structure for representing a stereotyped situation, like being in a certain kind of living room, or going to a child's birthday party. Attached to each frame are several kinds of information. Some of this information is about how to use the frame. Some is about what one can expect to happen next. Some is about what to do if these expectations are not confirmed. The "top levels" of a frame are fixed, and represent things that are always true about the supposed situation. The lower levels have many "slots" that must be filled by specific instances or data. Collections of related frames are linked together into frame-systems. The effects of important actions are mirrored by transformations between the frames of a system. These are used to make certain kinds of calculations economical, to represent changes of emphasis and attention and to account for effectiveness of "imagery". In Vision, the different frames of a system describe the scene from different viewpoints, and the transformations between one frame and another represent the effects of moving from place to place. Other kinds of frame-systems can represent actions, cause-effect relations, or changes in conceptual viewpoint. The paper applies the frame-system idea also to problems of linguistic understanding: memory, acquisition and retrieval of knowledge, and a variety of ways to reason by analogy and jump to conclusions based on partial similarity matching.},

abstract = {Shortly after shape grammars were invented by Stiny and Gips, a two part project for shape grammars was outlined by Stiny. In a 1976 paper,1 Stiny described "two exercises in formal composition". These simple exercises became the foundation for the many applications of shape grammars that followed, and suggested the potential of such applications in education and practice. The first exercise showed how shape grammars could be used in original composition, that is, the creation of new design languages or styles from scratch. The second exercise showed how shape grammars could be used to analyze known or existing design languages. Both exercises illustrated the unique characteristics of the shape grammar formalism that helped motivate a quarter century (almost!) of shape grammar work. General but simple, formal yet intuitive: qualities that continue to make shape grammar disciples and confound skeptics. The history of shape grammar applications in architecture and the arts for the two complementary purposes of synthesis and analysis, as well as for a third, joint purpose is sketched in the first section of this report. These three categories of applications do not have rigid boundaries. They are used in this report mostly as a framework for discussion. An overview of the roles of shape grammar applications in education and practice is given in the second section. New and ongoing issues concerning shape grammars in education and practice are discussed in the last section.},

abstract = {People since ages in order to meet different requirements of various space ~have embarked on a search. This basically human actions in their own quest for space accommodates. In shaping the nature of space in a variety of human needs and requests plays an important role. This configuration gives the determinants of physical, cultural phenomena or may be living habits. Places, shaped in accordance with the principles set according to the needs of people makes sense. This is for a variety of actions depending on the requirements to places with different functions are needed. In the first ages, which means exchange of goods trade concept has always been a part of human life. Trade concept has changed in parallel to the development in human life. Hand in their cars or outdoor areas open markets that have been made to this action series, over time, the community requirements, in parallel with economic and technological developments have been moved indoors. With the change of community life in commercial buildings' architectural and spatial fiction began to form. Thus, together with the changing commercial structure designed spaces to spaces of shopping action changed by showing the development of today's IDs. Shopping, in human history not only take the necessary relief, but also characterized as a social action. Therefore, shopping store design is important. Shops generally, offers similar product types, that they are stores in its inside consumer walk around, analyze, try and buy products. Shop with us today are classified according to selling goods to species and to their position. In designing a shopping venue, the magazine of the interior and facade design has an important role. Firstly, in shop{\textquoteright}s interior design sold product and nature of the product is determined. Then according to product, the design concept of the shop is emerged. Depending on their potential consumer and shop design rules are created.~ Shops, fashion and trends, also according to consumer demand is constantly changing places. Of course, this change is carried out in the framework of a specific design pattern. If the scope of the thesis as it would complicate the program that produced only clothing store focused on. Example models of plan schemes produced in this study being questioned, also created algorithm is measured in the first phase of the design the convenience it provides. In grammar-based design method, the relationship between forms, design builder is the basic idea. These relationships not only can be constructed based on the geometry of pure form, but also the form can be edited according to the meaning given to. Form selection and determination of the relationship between forms is determined by design problems, program and designer{\textquoteright}s review. The conventional design methods affect in the same way computer-aided design factors of design and this will impact on the design process, computer-aided design tools and designers communication is important. The designer, enter together the chance to intervene in the computer-aided design method of control. The designer handle the chance to check the options as which rule applies where, when, how, and when to start, when it will end. In this way, decisions are provided by the designer, the method of design control and ~flow is directed. The control of these stages, the designer's foresights and intuitions is important. If the designer can predict which can reproduce the forms and software in this direction control, the nature of work and wealth can be increased as well. Rule-based alternatives to replicate both in terms of design, both of which are common characteristics and to obtain different from each other in terms of design provides conveniences. Thanks to computer technology to be transferred to a computer-based design rules and in the use of the rapid developments. Design world in the form of production mechanism, is working by the rules of shape grammar. An important feature of the shape grammar is that it can allows to trace back. So, in order to try out alternatives, has a feature as in its inference to return to the previous form. In shape gramars rules are not expressed a ~symbolic expression, is directly expressed through with shapes. Shape rules can be considered steady answers given to steady states. However, the rules of grammar are not limiting, only are the tools used in creating a way from known to unknown. Shape grammars are provided with two advantageous aspects. The first is a certainty, according to the previous approach to the classification of shapes more perfect way method is followed. The second is a generality, is generally neutral, equal to all styles and focuses on introspective features. Both are attentive and eclectic. In the world of design with the use of the computer as a common, computer logic can be easily adapted to the computer environment that is compatible with the rule-based design methods began to emerge to the fore. Shape grammars is a system of rules for the design language of to define and create spatial compositions. Rule-based design methods is made with the format, which is one of the grammar logic of a design method to analyze; even subtracting the format rules, the rule change, which is sited to the base of the design of the computer environment with the logic of the same design or convert it to possible new designs creation. In this thesis, some shops an example for shop design are examined, analyzed and designed out of the system that produces new plan schemas. In this study, the production of a program that offers alternatives to the abstract background to the designer in early design process. Due to the intensive use of clothing shops, especially in the design of the shop are emphasized. Within the scope of the work, using the power of the computer's calculation, producing over alternative plans focuses on improving the program. In this way, the design process in a short time, the opportunity to work through many plan alternatives is born and it has become an easy examination of large areas. With these alternatives, possible problems that may occur are intended to provide prior and rapid detection. At this point, by applying a small number of rules to be seen a large number of alternative plans targeted, it is intended to make suitable selection of alternatives. In the scope of thesis, enterance, showcase, cash desk, storage ve changing cubicles are shop{\textquoteright}s spatial elements and their settlements are produced alternatively. As a priority, objective of the thesis, the scope and the methodology are discussed. Then the definition of the rule-based systems, properties, application areas and related species are given. Shape grammar with different studies is examined and shape grammar techniques are analyzed. Other section general information about the shop are provided, shop design criteria are described and in this context in the literature survey is conducted. According to the criteria specified in the existing shop designs are analyzed and evaluated. In application section, shape grammar-based design method developed for shop design has been transferred. In early stages of shop design a useable model is produced and the program that works on plan shemas are evaluated. Certain rules and limitations are defined with shape grammar and the resulting sample models are evaluated. The model is applied on studied samples and different design alternatives are produced. Algorithm put into computer-based enviroment with C{\#} software. In the conclusion, objectives for developing the method in the following stages are disclosed obtaining by evaluating the plan schemes. Thanks to model different plan shemes to see and these include comments with respect to the user to select the most appropriate is aimed. Alternatives produced with the help of the computer, so that compared results between each other. Whereby step by step the most appropriate design is selected. This is a interactive model which the designer{\textquoteright}s control is in the foreground. Also model shows efficiency in formation of shape and in user-oriented designs that the guiding was concluded. The program used components, with given many of the rules, generates different rule-based alternative. Some of the results obtained and predictable results expected and some are unexpected results. Unexpected results may lead designer. These results are not used directly, user intervention or even the architect's rendition is capable become available. With the development of recommendations and deepening methods to further reduce the burden of the designer can be achieved. The method followed in the process of shop design is considered successful due to its contribution and the opportunities for rule-based system. This works for all types of shops in the development of plan schemes are expected to contribute.},

abstract = {In the mythic construct of the West, nature, for a considerable era, has served as a seminal broker in basal underpinning discourse. This is despite nature's commutative, convertible and contradictory
disclosures. As the antithesis of socio-culture, nature has been the arena of the given, of necessity and compulsion, and a zone of constraint. As "Nature" it has worked as the precipitate of humanity and ministered as the model for human activity. To violate the norms of nature, to be unnatural, has
been considered unhealthy, amoral and illegal.
Following the Second World War, constructs of nature, socio-culture and norms were altered in design education and practice. Postwar, an emerging discourse of computer-related technologies contributed to reconfiguring representations of architecture, engineering, product and urban planning in the US and UK. The collective driving these changes became known as the Design Methods movement. Together with trajectories of thought in psychology and psychiatry, discourses materializing from such fields as cybernetics, operations research, information theory and computers altered design processes and education.
This dissertation ranges from examining the politics of funding surrounding an urban planning research center in Cambridge, Massachusetts to elucidating conferences concerning, architecture, engineering, urban planning and product design in the UK. Taking from media theorist Friedrich Kittler that technologically possible manipulations condition what can become a discourse, this dissertation is structured around two threads. One thread concerns how computer-related technologies configured a re-conceptualization of nature and socio-culture in design practice and education. A second thread examines how psychology and psychoanalytic concerns were reworked for design through a lens of computer related technologies. A line between the natural and the normative is questioned concerning concepts of abnormality and deviation.},

La technologie de l'information du b{\^a}timent (BIM) est un moyen technique important pour am{\'e}liorer l'industrie de la construction, pour la conception du b{\^a}timent de la ville et la construction de la meilleure recherche et l'application de la technologie BIM est la cl{\'e}, de g{\'e}rer efficacement les informations du cycle de vie du b{\^a}timent et de r{\'e}aliser le partage et l'{\'e}change. Cette th{\`e}se a {\'e}tudi{\'e} l'acquisition et le traitement des donn{\'e}es de mod{\'e}lisation. Google Earth et le logiciel ArcGIS sont principalement utilis{\'e}s pour acqu{\'e}rir et traiter des donn{\'e}es d'images-cartes et des donn{\'e}es de cartes d'{\'e}l{\'e}vation de la zone cible, ces deux types de correspondance et de superposition de donn{\'e}es, qui peuvent g{\'e}n{\'e}rer des donn{\'e}es de terrain urbain 3D avec des informations de localisation g{\'e}ographique. Ensuite OpenStreetMap est utilis{\'e} pour acqu{\'e}rir les donn{\'e}es routi{\`e}res de la zone cible, et il peut {\^e}tre optimis{\'e} pour le r{\'e}seau routier n{\'e}cessaire par le logiciel JOSM. La technologie de balayage laser 3D est utilis{\'e}e pour collecter des images de texture de surface de b{\^a}timent et pour cr{\'e}er le mod{\`e}le de nuages de points de la mod{\'e}lisation d'architecture cible afin d'obtenir les dimensions de mod{\'e}lisation par mesure. Sur cette base, cette th{\`e}se a principalement {\'e}tudi{\'e} le principe et le processus de la r{\`e}gle CGA pour cr{\'e}er des mod{\`e}les de construction, et {\'e}tudi{\'e} la m{\'e}thode qui peut s{\'e}parer les {\'e}l{\'e}ments architecturaux en utilisant la segmentation d'image pour g{\'e}n{\'e}rer automatiquement la r{\`e}gle CGA et de cr{\'e}er ensuite le mod{\`e}le de construction. Ainsi, des mod{\`e}les de construction 3D ont {\'e}t{\'e} {\'e}tablis dans le logiciel CityEngine en utilisant les r{\`e}gles CGA et la technologie de segmentation des fa{\c c}ades. Cette th{\`e}se a construit le mod{\`e}le d'information int{\'e}gr{\'e} au b{\^a}timent urbain (CBIIM) bas{\'e} sur BIM. L'information sur la construction de la ville est class{\'e}e et int{\'e}gr{\'e}e, et le b{\^a}timent et la composante ont {\'e}t{\'e} d{\'e}crits avec la norme IFC, afin de g{\'e}rer efficacement les informations du cycle de vie du b{\^a}timent. Cette th{\`e}se {\'e}tudie la technologie du mod{\`e}le d'association d'information int{\'e}gr{\'e}e, qui permet de r{\'e}aliser une conception standardis{\'e}e des composants avec des caract{\'e}ristiques associ{\'e}es et une conception intelligente des b{\^a}timents avec des param{\`e}tres associ{\'e}s dans les r{\`e}gles de connaissances combin{\'e}es avec l'IFC. La technologie de simulation de la construction de visualisation est {\'e}tudi{\'e}e. Les r{\`e}gles de connaissance dans le mod{\`e}le d'information int{\'e}gr{\'e} fournissent une r{\'e}f{\'e}rence fiable pour la simulation de construction, et la sc{\`e}ne de simulation est cr{\'e}{\'e}e en invoquant le mod{\`e}le d'information int{\'e}gr{\'e}, ainsi le processus de simulation est termin{\'e}. En prenant le campus Baoshan de l'Universit{\'e} de Shanghai comme exemple, le processus de mod{\'e}lisation de la sc{\`e}ne enti{\`e}re est illustr{\'e}, et les {\'e}tapes de mod{\'e}lisation de toutes sortes d'objets 3D sont d{\'e}crites en d{\'e}tail pour r{\'e}soudre les probl{\`e}mes sp{\'e}cifiques dans le processus de mod{\'e}lisation r{\'e}elle. Ainsi, la faisabilit{\'e} et la validit{\'e} de la m{\'e}thode de mod{\'e}lisation intelligente proc{\'e}durale sont v{\'e}rifi{\'e}es. Prenant comme exemple le dortoir de l'Universit{\'e} de Shanghai, une simulation et le mod{\`e}le de simulation ont {\'e}t{\'e} cr{\'e}{\'e}s par les informations int{\'e}gr{\'e}es, combin{\'e}es aux informations de construction pertinentes, la simulation de construction a {\'e}t{\'e} compl{\'e}t{\'e}e par le programme. Ainsi, la faisabilit{\'e} et la validit{\'e} du CBIIM sont v{\'e}rifi{\'e}es.},

abstract = {Computer games often take place in extensive virtual worlds, attractive for roaming and exploring. Unfortunately, current virtual cities can strongly hinder this kind of gameplay, since the buildings they feature typically have replicated interiors, or no interiors at all. Procedural content generation is becoming more established, with many techniques for automatically creating specific building elements. However, the integration of these techniques to form complete buildings is still largely unexplored, limiting their application to open game worlds. We propose a novel approach that integrates existing procedural techniques to generate such buildings. With minimal extensions, individual techniques can be coordinated to create buildings with consistently interrelated exteriors and interiors, as in the real world. Our solution offers a framework where various procedural techniques communicate with a moderator, which is responsible for negotiating the placement of building elements, making use of a library of semantic classes and constraints. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by presenting several examples featuring the integration of a fa{\&}{\#}x00E7;ade shape grammar, two different floor plan layout generation techniques, and furniture placement techniques. We conclude that this approach allows one to preserve the individual qualities of existing procedural techniques, while assisting the consistency maintenance of the generated buildings.},

During the last decade developments in 3D Geoinformation (GI) system have made substantial progress. We are about to have a more complete spatial model and understanding of our planet in different scales. Hence, various communities and cities offer 3D landscape and 3D city models as valuable source and instrument for sustainable management of rural and urban resources. Also municipal utilities, real estate companies benefit from recent developments related to 3D applications. In order to present recent developments and to discuss future trends, academics and practitioners met at the 7th International Workshop on 3D Geoinformation. This book comprises a selection of evaluated, high quality papers that were presented at this workshop in May 2012. The topics focus explicitly on the last achievements (methods, algorithms, models, systems) with respect to 3D GeoInformation requirements. The book is aimed at decision makers and experts as well at students interested in the 3D component of geographical information science including GI engineers, computer scientists, photogrammetrists, land surveyors, urban planners, and mapping specialists.},

abstract = {One of the applications of generation to the production of designs is embodied in the idea of the shape grammar. In this paper, a shape grammar model, which is based on the generative capability of grammar and the reasoning capabilities of knowledge-based systems and their integration in a prototype, is introduced. The model, which operates in a top-down manner, can be described at three levels. At the first level, a vocabulary for an architectural language of row-houses is formed by analysing this type of house syntactically and formally. At the second level, this vocabulary is transformed into a shape grammar. Finally, a syntactic system is defined as a space of possible designs according to these analyses. An interface design has been carried out to facilitate the communication between the users and the model during the design process.},

abstract = {The output of interdisciplinary research is unexpected that one particular field cannot reach with his/her own expertise. In traditional architectural workflow, computational tools associated with performance simulation are utilized during the later stage of the design process following the concept design. However, this reduces the efficiency by alterations of the conceptual model. Based on the fact that material, form and performance aspects of design can be integrated together, by specifying their parameters, rules and relationships as observed in natural systems, a Material-based Integrated Computational Design Model (MICD-m) in architecture is developed combining architectural design with biology, material science, mathematics, mechanical engineering, structural engineering and computer science for the early stage use in architectural design. A custom-designed user interface, database and reports are included in the MICD-m, designed as a plug-in for a 3D geometric modelling tool. The MICD-m is tested with a case study in parametric modelling environment.},

It has two parts: a grammar editor and a stand-alone interpreter. The editor is the modeling application Rhinoceros3d using Python scripts. The interpreter is general, is three-dimensional, and supports subshape detection. A grammar is a Rhinoceros3d model; thus users can manipulate all its parts directly and immediately. That is, they can modify any shape without selecting or invoking an editor, and they can lay out the parts of the grammar in any way they find meaningful. Using this approach, which I call a whole-grammar approach, users are shielded from most subdomain tasks, like typing text files or specifying transformations. Informal observations suggest that users of this implementation can work effectively.</p></div>},

The resulting shape grammar interpreter tries to support designers{\textquoteright} ways of thinking and working by acting as a bridge between shape grammars, the formalism that captures a design process, and a CAD application, for post-processing the computed design. This bridge is implemented by Rosetta, which ensures portability among different CAD applications.},

The shape grammar method is used for the analysis and synthesis of the hayat house type in a particular context. In the analysis part, the shape grammar method is used to extract basic compositional principles of the hayat house. In the synthesis part, first the evolution of a new hayat house prototype is illustrated. An algorithmic prototype transformation is considered. This transformation is achieved in two ways: by changing the values assigned to the variables that define the component objects of the form, and by replacing the vocabulary elements of the form with new ones. Then, the application of the rule based design method for housing pattern generation is explored. The design of a housing complex is illustrated using this method.},
