abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Cambridge University Press. Since the introduction of spatial grammars 45 years ago, numerous grammars have been developed in a variety of fields from architecture to engineering design. Their benefits for solution space exploration when computationally implemented and combined with optimization have been demonstrated. However, there has been limited adoption of spatial grammars in engineering applications for various reasons. One main reason is the missing, automated, generalized link between the designs generated by the spatial grammar and their evaluation through finite-element analysis (FEA). However, the combination of spatial grammars with optimization and simulation has the advantage over continuous structural topology optimization in that explicit constraints, for example, modeling style and fabrication processes, can be included in the spatial grammar. This paper discusses the challenges in providing a generalized approach by demonstrating the implementation of a framework that combines a three-dimensional spatial grammar interpreter with automated FEA and stochastic optimization using simulated annealing (SA). Guidelines are provided for users to design spatial grammars in conjunction with FEA and integrate automatic application of boundary conditions. A simulated annealing method for use with spatial grammars is also presented including a new method to select rules through a neighborhood definition. To demonstrate the benefits of the framework, it is applied to the automated design and optimization of spokes for inline skate wheels. This example highlights the advantage of spatial grammars for modeling style and additive manufacturing (AM) constraints within the generative system combined with FEA and optimization to carry out topology and shape optimization. The results verify that the framework can generate structurally optimized designs within the style and AM constraints defined in the spatial grammar, and produce a set of topologically diverse, yet valid design solutions.},

abstract = {<div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="normal"><p>Currently available computer-aided design tools provide strong support for the later stages of product development processes where the structure and shape of the design have been fixed. Support for earlier stages of product development, when both the structure and shape of the design are still fluid, demands conceptual design tools that support designers' ways of thinking and working, and enhance creativity, for example, by offering design alternatives, difficult or not, possible without the use of such tools. The potential of spatial grammars as a technology to support such design tools has been demonstrated through experimental research prototypes since the 1970s. In this paper, we provide a review of recent spatial grammar implementations, which were presented in the Design Computing and Cognition 2010 workshop on which this paper is based, in the light of requirements for conceptual design tools and identify future research directions in both research and design education.</p></div>},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Kim Williams Books, Turin. A method of visualization of four-dimensional objects using a double orthogonal parallel projection onto two orthogonal three-dimensional spaces is proposed. A synthetic approach, with the use of basic descriptive geometry tools of Monge{\textquoteright}s projection in interactive 3D graphical software, is taken. Descriptive constructions of projections of points, lines, planes and three-dimensional spaces are shown. Methods of measuring true lengths of segments and rotating projections of objects into the modeling space are described. The focus lies on improving the spatial ability and understanding of the four-dimensional space. An example of a construction is carried out on a model of tesseract. All the constructions are analogies of constructions in Monge{\textquoteright}s projection of a three-dimensional space. With advantages of interactive computer graphics, the constructions are easy to perform, and objects are easy to manipulate with.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2018. Computer numerical control (CNC) cutting machines have become essential tools for designers and architects enabling rapid prototyping, model building, and production of high-quality components. Designers often cut from new materials, discarding the irregularly shaped remains. We introduce ProjecTables, a visual augmented reality system for interactive packing of model parts onto sheet materials. ProjecTables enables designers to (re)use scrap materials for computer numerical control cutting that would have been previously thrown away, at the same time supporting esthetic choices related to wood grain, avoiding surface blemishes, and other relevant material properties. We conducted evaluations of ProjecTables with design students from Aarhus School of Architecture, demonstrating that participants could quickly and easily place and orient model parts reducing material waste. Contextual interviews and ideation sessions led to a deeper understanding of current work practices and sustainability issues with computer numerical control cutting machines and identified useful features for interactive packing to reduce waste while supporting esthetic concerns for exhibition quality design projects.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Cambridge University Press. The ability to work with ambiguity and compute new designs based on both defined and emergent shapes are unique advantages of shape grammars. Realizing these benefits in design practice requires the implementation of general purpose shape grammar interpreters that support: (a) the detection of arbitrary subshapes in arbitrary shapes and (b) the application of shape rules that use these subshapes to create new shapes. The complexity of currently available interpreters results from their combination of shape computation (for subshape detection and the application of rules) with computational geometry (for the geometric operations need to generate new shapes). This paper proposes a shape grammar implementation method for three-dimensional circular arcs represented as rational quadratic B{\'e}zier curves based on lattice theory that reduces this complexity by separating steps in a shape computation process from the geometrical operations associated with specific grammars and shapes. The method is demonstrated through application to two well-known shape grammars: Stiny's triangles grammar and Jowers and Earl's trefoil grammar. A prototype computer implementation of an interpreter kernel has been built and its application to both grammars is presented. The use of B{\'e}zier curves in three dimensions opens the possibility to extend shape grammar implementations to cover the wider range of applications that are needed before practical implementations for use in real life product design and development processes become feasible.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Copyright Cambridge University Press 2018. In inspiration and fixation experiments, example designs are often provided along with the instructions for how participants should treat them. However, research has not reached a consensus about the influence of such instructions, leading to difficulties in understanding how the examples and the instructions each affect idea generation. We conducted an experiment in which 303 participants designed for the same design problem, while given different examples and instructions, which ranged from strongly encouraging copying the examples to strongly discouraging copying. Exposure to the examples affected the number and type of ideas generated, whereas exposure to the instructions did not. However, instructions did affect how participants incorporated features of the examples in their ideas. Encouraged groups incorporated many features of the examples, while also incorporating structural features more than conceptual ones. Surprisingly, the incorporation of features in discouraged groups was not different from that of groups given no instructions or even no stimulus. This indicates that concrete features may be easier to recognize and reproduce than abstract ones, and that encouraging instructions are more effective than discouraging ones, despite how strict or lenient those instructions are. The manipulation of different features also allowed us to observe how similar approaches to solving a design problem can compete for attention and how the calculation of feature repetition can be misleading depending on how common or obvious the features might be. These findings have implications for the interpretation of results from fixation studies, and for the development of design tools that present stimuli to assist idea generation.},

The algebraic model is mathematically uniform for shapes of all kinds and provides a natural and intuitive framework for mixed-dimensional shapes. The corresponding maximal element representation is essential to the concept of shape emergence. The representation scheme particularly supports computational design as a generative process of search or exploration. This thesis begins with a treatment of the algebraic and geometric properties of shapes and gives a formal and complete definition of the maximal element representation for n-dimensional shapes in a k-dimensional space (n ? k). Efficient algorithms are presented for the algebraic operations of sum, product, difference and symmetric difference on shapes of plane and volume segments. An exploration of related research in shape grammars, computational design and construction simulation, illustrates the potential of this representation scheme, while an agenda for future research depicts its present shortcomings.},

In order to test three common claims about parametric design and creativity, this article describes the results of a study that compares the cognitive processes of a small set of designers, with the results of an independent assessment of the levels of creativity visible in their work. Specifically, using a combination of protocol analysis (of the design process) and consensual assessment (of the design outcome), the research explores three suggested indicators of a connection between cognitive activities and creativity. The three indicators are geometry versus algorithm use, problem-driven versus solution-driven processes, and expert versus novice activities. Through this research, the article contributes to a heightened understanding of the actual, rather than theorized, relationship between parametric design and creativity.},

Our techniques are similar to the methods used in Monge{\textquoteright}s projection of the three-dimensional space. Constructions are created in the interactive 3D modeling software GeoGebra 5, in which the user can freely move some input elements. We focus on a synthetic approach to description of the four-dimensional space with the use of descriptive geometry tools.},

The aim of the article is to describe the historical background and the birth of a relatively new discipline consisting in the digital evolution of classical stereotomy. {\textquotedblleft}Stereotomy 1.0{\textquotedblright} comprises the early development of the discipline primarily related to stonecutting. The new discipline, {\textquotedblleft}Stereotomy 2.0{\textquotedblright} goes beyond this early concept to embrace contemporary design paradigms and materials. It is described in an {\textquotedblleft}Unfinished Manifesto{\textquotedblright}, which describes its fundamental theoretical principles, understood as a new didactic comprehensive approach for the schools of architecture and a new design process useful for contemporary architectural design. Each point of the Manifesto is described in a short paragraph and shows the most important theoretical nodes of the renewed discipline. The various points are then exemplified by the experimental projects presented in the final part of the article.},

From a historical analysis of hemispherical domes and from the rigorous study of geometric methods to divide a sphere, this study presents innovative solutions for bonding a hemispherical stereotomic dome in cut stone, solutions that optimize its construction compared to traditional methods. This result is achieved through a five-fold structural geometry of bonding that reduces the number of invariant-ashlars to be produced in relation to maintaining their reduced dimensions and increasing the diameter of the dome they constitute, respecting static laws and improving aesthetic expressivity, and through modern technologies for designing and cutting building elements, thus simplifying the production process.},

The goal is to create the basis for a system that could capture some features of the existing urban fabric and apply them in contemporary urban planning and architectural design. The methodology used is described, from the initial historical analysis and fieldwork to the identification of three subgrammars necessary to encode the complexity of the urban preexistences: the urban grammar, the negotiation grammar, and the housing grammar. Topdown and bottom-up approaches to grammar design are analyzed and compared. The bottom-up urban grammar developed is then described, and a hand derivation of the existing urban fabric is proposed. Visual, symbolic, and tagged computer implementations of shape grammars are briefly discussed and a novel design generated by the tagged interpreter is presented.

Karbandi is an arched covering pattern in Persian architecture which provides the interior of a structure with a particular geometric elegance and integrates architecture and structure in the creation of a meaningful spaces. The use of these structures is highly demanded in contemporary Persian architecture but requires a creative, modern design and construction strategy in order to meet new requirements, since traditional methods for implementing them causes them to be applicable only on regular bases. Here the authors investigate a solution to broaden their use over irregular geometry. This paper also aims at determining the possibility of administrating Karbandi geometry in the boundaries of an irregular polygonal shape. The result of this paper shows that it is possible to calculate and implement a Karbandi geometry in irregular bases when some specific conditions are met.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2018. This article presents design research speculating on computationally enabled planning approaches for urban sites where informal developments make conventional masterplans ineffectual. The project advances the thesis that the spatial complexity of urban sites can be effectively studied through a network or mesh representation and that rapid change in informal settlements is not an obstacle to planned redevelopment but can be addressed through dynamic modeling and punctual interventions. In this way, the rapid turnover of the built environment can be a mechanism through which to introduce directed planning without canceling out bottom-up actions. In the case study presented, we use a multiagent approach that is able to adapt to a continuously changing context. The agents are driven by weighted random walks and compute localized analyses of the morphology of the network of public space as they move. The information generated by the multiagent simulation is aggregated to identify potential modifications to the urban fabric, with an emphasis on pedestrian connectivity.},

A particular mosaic at the Darb-e Imam mausoleum in Isfahan has caused some controversy 10~years ago when it was claimed to exhibit quasi-periodic properties and that it was 500~years old. The technical part of this claim has been disputed (and refuted) by several authors. The date, 1453, also a key part~of~the press coverage that medieval Islamic artisans did advanced mathematics 500~years before the West, has not been challenged. We argue that the panel in question dates from the end of the Safavid period (1715{\textendash}1717). Techniques developed during the Safavid period seem to be wrongly attributed to the fifteenth century.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Kim Williams Books, Turin. This paper describes the adaptation of the Exquisite Corpse to the design of a vault, cut using only ruled surfaces. The Surrealist process of the Exquisite Corpse, where a group of artists work collectively on a single drawing, without seeing the work of their collaborators, Salvador Dal{\'\i} called working in {\textquotedblleft}semi-darkness{\textquotedblright}. This method succeeds however in producing complex combinations of forms that rarely emerge from solo designers. When a project arose for a vault in a remote environment, the Exquisite Corpse was chosen to generate complimentary and juxtaposing forms from which an architectural language could be later assembled. A model of the vault was fabricated using a robotic arm with a custom built nichrome wire foam cutting end effector from 107 billets of expanded polystyrene. The discussion notes the stereotomic challenges, the differences between the modelled outcome and its stone version, and reflects on maintaining {\textquotedblleft}semi-darkness{\textquotedblright} during early stages of form design.},

We investigate facilitating shape subtraction and addition with two-dimensional (planar) non-uniform rational basis-spline (NURB) curves with the codes and conventions of modeling while preserving the visual continuity of curved shapes. Our proposed tool, developed in a common digital modeling environment, automates the adjustment of parameters for tangential continuity of curves in shape rule applications. When the user designates a curve range to subtract from an initial shape and provides a new curved shape to add to it, the tool splits the initial shape, scales and aligns the curve to be added to fit into this range, introduces additional control points at the joining ends of the new curve to preserve continuity and redraws the new curve. We present a sample set of design variations produced using this practical approach which can be utilized as a method or become part of an automated NURB curve manipulation tool for designers.},

The impact of machine learning on architectural practices with performance-based design and fabrication is assessed in two cases by the authors.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Kim Williams Books, Turin. Muqarnas domes and cornices represent a unique element in Islamic architecture. Muqarnas embody a form of architectural ornament with a cellular structure. This style includes an endless variety of longitudinal friezes and, in particular, generates a system that builds astonishing vaults consisting of complex combinations of units that are challenging to distinguish. The geometric divisions of a squinch create a large number of mini-squinches that produce various Muqarnas arrangements. The Muqarnas architectural ornament can be understood by juxtaposing the different individual forms together to cover a space, creating a vault, dome or linear cornice. Here, we aim to investigate the origins of the Muqarnas cellular structure and to establish the substantial difference between the Muqarnas located in the Eastern and Western regions. Emphasis is then placed on the methodologies for assembling and building the Muqarnas in the Maghreb and Andalusia.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} Cambridge University Press 2017. System architecture is important for the design of complex mechatronic systems because it acts as an intermediator between conceptual design and detail design. An explicit and exact system modeling language is imperative for successful architecture design. However, some deficiencies remain, such as the lack of geometry elements, hybrid behavior description, and specific association semantics for existing architecture modeling languages. In this study, a Systems Modeling Language extension for mechatronic system architecture modeling called ArchME is proposed. The requirements for the mechatronic System Modeling Language are analyzed, and the metamodels are defined. Then, the modeling elements are determined. Finally, the profiles based on the systems modeling language are defined to support the modeling of function, behavior, structure, and their association. This enables system designers to model the system architecture and facilitates communication between different stakeholders. A case study is provided to demonstrate the modeling capability of ArchME.},

abstract = {This is a partial theory of thinking, combining a number of classical and modern concepts from psychology, linguistics, and AI. Whenever one encounters a new situation (or makes a substantial change in one's viewpoint) he selects from memory a structure called a frame, a remembered framework to be adopted to fit reality by changing details as necessary. A frame is a data-structure for representing a stereotyped situation, like being in a certain kind of living room, or going to a child's birthday party. Attached to each frame are several kinds of information. Some of this information is about how to use the frame. Some is about what one can expect to happen next. Some is about what to do if these expectations are not confirmed. The "top levels" of a frame are fixed, and represent things that are always true about the supposed situation. The lower levels have many "slots" that must be filled by specific instances or data. Collections of related frames are linked together into frame-systems. The effects of important actions are mirrored by transformations between the frames of a system. These are used to make certain kinds of calculations economical, to represent changes of emphasis and attention and to account for effectiveness of "imagery". In Vision, the different frames of a system describe the scene from different viewpoints, and the transformations between one frame and another represent the effects of moving from place to place. Other kinds of frame-systems can represent actions, cause-effect relations, or changes in conceptual viewpoint. The paper applies the frame-system idea also to problems of linguistic understanding: memory, acquisition and retrieval of knowledge, and a variety of ways to reason by analogy and jump to conclusions based on partial similarity matching.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Cambridge University Press. The ability to work with ambiguity and compute new designs based on both defined and emergent shapes are unique advantages of shape grammars. Realizing these benefits in design practice requires the implementation of general purpose shape grammar interpreters that support: (a) the detection of arbitrary subshapes in arbitrary shapes and (b) the application of shape rules that use these subshapes to create new shapes. The complexity of currently available interpreters results from their combination of shape computation (for subshape detection and the application of rules) with computational geometry (for the geometric operations need to generate new shapes). This paper proposes a shape grammar implementation method for three-dimensional circular arcs represented as rational quadratic B{\'e}zier curves based on lattice theory that reduces this complexity by separating steps in a shape computation process from the geometrical operations associated with specific grammars and shapes. The method is demonstrated through application to two well-known shape grammars: Stiny's triangles grammar and Jowers and Earl's trefoil grammar. A prototype computer implementation of an interpreter kernel has been built and its application to both grammars is presented. The use of B{\'e}zier curves in three dimensions opens the possibility to extend shape grammar implementations to cover the wider range of applications that are needed before practical implementations for use in real life product design and development processes become feasible.},

abstract = {Caves and cities are normally found at the opposite ends of the architectural spectrum. The former is typically perceived as a primitive, undesigned object, part of nature; the latter is held as the height of civilized planning and rationality. At the Greco-Roman city of Magnesia on the Maeander in western Turkey, however, these two typologies were intimately bound together in unexpected ways. Magnesia on the Maeander was the site of the ancient cult of a cave-dwelling Apollo at Hylai, whose devotees were sometimes imbued with a supernatural strength that enabled them to jump from high cliffs and rush through the mountains carrying entire trees that they had torn up by the roots. City and cave appear to have been linked through a complex dynamic of movement in which the frenzied tree-carriers ended up depositing their burdens at a city-center sanctuary of Dionysos. This movement provides an alternative way of understanding the layout of the city, and augments the scant archaeological remains of the street grid. Drawing on textual and empirical evidence, this study seeks to understand if the city grid, its main thoroughfares, and the orientation of its buildings were influenced by the desire to connect to important topographical features such as the cave of Apollo. The reconstitution of these dynamics into a synthetic urban topography requires the collation of incomplete evidence from a variety of different sources and time periods, including historical accounts, numismatics, inscriptions found on the site, architectural remains, geographical surveys, and the preservation of toponyms in local memory. This project makes use of procedural modeling, an emerging 3D mapping technique that facilitates the generation of hypothetical three-dimensional visualizations based on geographically located data to explore a series of focused questions about the impact of cultic practice and landscape on the urban layout of Magnesia on the Maeander. The first set of questions is spatio-empirical in nature, and concerns the reconstruction of Magnesia's city plan. The second seeks to elucidate a 'topography of ritual' at Magnesia and explore the ways in which this network of natural places and religious sites coexisted with, and undermined, the spatial system constituted by the city grid. The idea of the cave and its role in Greek architecture is the third object of study, as represented at Magnesia by the sanctuary of Apollo. Finally, these questions form a case study for a critique of the value and potential of the procedural modeling methodology. As a whole, the project aims to contribute to knowledge of the landscape and built environment of Asia Minor in the archaic through Roman periods, as well as entering into discourses of theory and praxis in the Digital Humanities.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2018. Architectural designs are visualised on computer screens through arrays of pixels and vectors. These representations differ from the reality of buildings, which over time will unavoidably age and decay. How, then, do digital designs age over time? Do we interpret glitching as a sudden malfunction or fault in the computation of the design{\textquoteright}s underlying data, or as digital decay resulting not from the wear and tear of tangible materials but from the decomposition of the binary code, or from system changes that cannot appropriately interpret the data? By exploring a series of experimental design practices for deployments and understandings that are the consequence of malfunctions during computational processing, glitches are reinterpreted. Advancing from two-dimensional glitch art techniques into three-dimensional interpretations, the research employs a methodology of systematic iterative processes to explore design emergence based on glitches. The study presents digital architectural form existing solely in the digital realm, as an architectural interpretation of computational glitches through both its design process and aesthetic outcome. Thus, this research intends to bring a level of authenticity to the field through three-dimensional interpretations of glitch in an architectural form.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Kim Williams Books, Turin. The project for an acoustic shell in the Italian city of Matera was looked as an opportunity to explore an alternative stereotomic approach. The semi-vaulted space was initially thought to be built with discrete blocks of stone following a structural system in compression bounded by tie-rods, but practical and economic sustainability issues led to a different approach to that of classic cutting and carving raw stone. The collaboration between two different research teams led to the incorporation of a reusable mold technology; with the help of robotic technology and flexible moulding, it became possible to create customized heavy blocks discarding the need for disposable one-off moulds for casting voussoirs. By surveying stereotomy as a classic discipline within the scope of this project, this paper extrapolates and reflects on the validation of a different production process facing the classic ones that have defined stereotomy in architecture and construction.},

These verbal descriptions can also assist in guiding the generative process. This paper presents a general notation for descriptions and description rules that accounts, extensively if not entirely, for many of the applications of description grammars found in literature. Specifically, a review of the notation with respect to these description schemes supports the explication of its strengths and limitations and the identification of future work. A follow-up paper revisits selected applications of description grammars and demonstrates the applicability of this general notation to these case studies.},

In this paper, we present Milan Zlokovi{\'c}{\textquoteright}s theorisation of reciprocal concatenation and its application in his architectural design. For two decades architect Milan Zlokovi{\'c} (1898{\textendash}1965), one of the founders of Modern Movement in Yugoslavia, studied what he called {\textquotedblleft}the science of proportions{\textquotedblright}. His findings have not received the attention they deserve. Here we analyse his research on proportional method of reciprocal concatenation through the ancient concept of analogy, the correlation among proportional systems, an ideal set of preferential numbers and the use of proportional dividers. Based on his theoretical views, we examined proportions in two of his buildings: the Elementary School in Jagodina (1937{\textendash}1940) and the Teacher Training School in Prizren (1960). Finally, we show that Zlokovi{\'c} combined reciprocal concatenation with various proportional systems, proving it to be a valuable tool for contemporary architectural design.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} Cambridge University Press 2017. This paper reports on a study characterizing design processes and the potential of design spaces through measuring the information entropy of empirical data derived from protocol studies. The sequential segments in a protocol analysis can be related to each other by examining their semantic content producing a design session's linkograph, which defines the design space for a design session. From a linkograph, it is possible to compute the probabilities of the connectivity of each segment for its forelinks and its backlinks, together with the probabilities of distance among links. A linkograph's entropy is a measure of the information in the design session. It is claimed that the entropy of the linkograph measures the potential of the design space being generated as the design proceeds chronologically. We present an approach to the automated construction of linkographs by connecting segments using the lexical database WordNet and measure its entropy. A case study of two design sessions with different characteristics was conducted, one considered more productive and creative, the other more pragmatic. Those segments with high entropy and those associated with high rates of change of entropy are analyzed. The creative session has a higher linkograph entropy.

This research challenges the long-standing paradigm that considers compositional analysis to be the key to researching historical Islamic geometric patterns. Adopting a mathematical description shows that the historical focus on existing forms has left the relevant structural similarities between historical Islamic geometric patterns understudied. The research focused on the hexagonal-based Islamic geometric patterns and found that historical designs correlate to each other beyond just the formal dimension and that deep, morphological connections exist in the structures of historical singularities. Using historical evidence, this article identifies these connections and presents a categorization system that groups designs together based on their {\textquotedblleft}morphogenetic{\textquotedblright} characteristics.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2018. Digital design paradigms in architecture have been rooted in representational models which are geometry centered and therefore fail to capture building complexity holistically. Due to a lack of computational design methodologies, existing digital design workflows do little in predicting design performance in the early design stage and in most cases analysis and design optimization are done after a design is fixed. This work proposes a new computational design methodology, intended for use in the area of conceptual design of building design. The proposed methodology is implemented into a multi-agent system design toolkit which facilitates the generation of design alternatives using stochastic algorithms and their evaluation using multiple environmental performance metrics. The method allows the user to probabilistically explore the solution space by modeling the design parameters{\textquoteright} architectural design components (i.e. fa{\c c}ade panel) into modular programming blocks (agents) which interact in a bottom-up fashion. Different problem requirements (i.e. level of daylight inside a space, openings) described into agents{\textquoteright} behavior allow for the coupling of data from different engineering fields (environmental design, structural design) into the a priori formation of architectural geometry. In the presented design experiment, a fa{\c c}ade panel is modeled into an agent-based fashion and the multi-agent system toolkit is used to generate and evolve alternative fa{\c c}ade panel configurations based on environmental parameters (daylight, energy consumption). The designer can develop the fa{\c c}ade panel geometry, design behaviors, and performance criteria to evaluate the design alternatives. The toolkit relies on modular and functionally specific programming modules (agents), which provide a platform for fa{\c c}ade design exploration by combining existing three-dimensional modeling and analysis software.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} Cambridge University Press 2018. Traditionally, design opportunities and directions are conceived based on expertise, intuition, or time-consuming user studies and marketing research at the fuzzy front end of the design process. Herein, we propose the use of the total technology space map (TSM) as a visual ideation aid for rapidly conceiving high-level design opportunities. The map is comprised of various technology domains positioned according to knowledge proximity, which is measured based on a large quantity of patent data. It provides a systematic picture of the total technology space to enable stimulated ideation beyond the designer's knowledge. Designers can browse the map and navigate various technologies to conceive new design opportunities that relate different technologies across the space. We demonstrate the process of using TSM as a rapid ideation aid and then analyze its applications in two experiments to show its effectiveness and limitations. Furthermore, we have developed a cloud-based system for computer-aided ideation, that is, InnoGPS, to integrate interactive map browsing for conceiving high-level design opportunities with domain-specific patent retrieval for stimulating concrete technical concepts, and to potentially embed machine-learning and artificial intelligence in the map-aided ideation process.},

The increased complexity of geometrical shapes in architecture asks for elaborated fabrication methods, which have to be adapted on a case-to-case basis. Kinetic modular structures can fulfil this task. These structures, by definition, employ a kinetic module, which is a deployable unit composed of hinged rigid bodies. Kinetic modular structures are reusable, adaptable to different forms, easily constructible and, theoretically, they allow the creation of kinematic structures. This paper presents a study to show the potentiality of such an approach, exploiting the properties of rigid origami like the triangular Resch{\textquoteright}s tessellation.},

An important task in the initial stages of most architectural design processes is the design of planar floor plans, that are composed of non-overlapping rooms divided from each other by walls while satisfying given topological and dimensional constraints. The work described in this paper is part of a larger research aimed at developing the mathematical theory for examining the feasibility of given topological constraints and providing a generic floor plan solution for all possible design briefs. In this paper, we mathematically describe universal (or generic) rectangular floor plans with n rooms, that is, the floor plans that topologically contain all possible rectangular floor plans with n rooms. Then, we present a graph-theoretical approach for enumerating generic rectangular floor plans upto nine rooms. At the end, we demonstrate the transformation of generic floor plans into a floor plan corresponding to a given graph.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Kim Williams Books, Turin. Each year, the United States discards 375 million tons of concrete construction debris to landfills. But this is a new paradigm. Past civilizations cannibalized their constructions to produce new architectures. This paper interrogates one cannibalistic methodology from the past known as Cyclopean Masonry in order to translate this valuable method into a contemporary digital procedure. The work contextualizes the techniques of this method and situates them into procedural recipes which can be applied in contemporary construction. A full-scale prototype utilizes the described method; demolition debris is gathered, scanned, and processed through the virtual algorithm. Each rubble unit is then minimally carved by a robotic arm and set to compose a new architecture from discarded rubble debris. The prototype merges ancient construction thinking with advanced digital procedures. It poses material cannibalism as a means of combatting excessive construction waste generation.},

Multiscale design and analysis models promise a robust, multimethod, multidisciplinary approach, but at present have limited application during the architectural design process. To explore the use of multiscale models in architecture, we develop a calibrated modeling and simulation platform for the design and analysis of a prototypical envelope made of phase change materials. The model is mechanistic in nature, incorporates material-scale and precinct scale-attributes, and supports the design of two- and three-dimensional phase change material geometries informed by heat transfer phenomena. Phase change material behavior, in solid and liquid states, dominates the visual and numerical evaluation of the multiscale model. Model calibration is demonstrated using real-time data gathered from the prototype. Model extensibility is demonstrated when it is used by designers to predict the behavior of alternate envelope options. Given the challenges of modeling phase change material behavior in this multiscale model, an additional multiple linear regression model is applied to data collected from the physical prototype in order to demonstrate an alternate method for predicting the melting and solidification of phase change materials.},

The method effectively analyzes the architectural structure and elements and achieves facade image segmentation. Specifically, we generate shape tree of facade image according to image segmentation. We adopt a top-down subdivision scheme to encode rules and a down-top merging scheme to generate 3D models with clear level of detail. Our method can subdivide low-resolution images with certain noise and distinguish prominent architectural elements. We can change the accuracy of models with three-dimensional components so that our models can meet the needs of large-scale urban three-dimensional reconstruction.},

The recent wave of developments and research in the field of deep learning and artificial intelligence is causing the border between the intuitive and deterministic domains to be redrawn, especially in computer vision and natural language processing. As designers frequently invoke vision and language in the context of design, this article takes a step back to ask if deep learning{\textquoteright}s capabilities might be applied to design workflows, especially in architecture. In addition to addressing this general question, the article discusses one of several prototypes, BIMToVec, developed to examine the use of deep learning in design. It employs techniques like those used in natural language processing to interpret building information models. The article also proposes a homogeneous data format, provisionally called a design pixel, which can store design information as spatial-semantic maps. This would make designers{\textquoteright} intuitive thoughts more accessible to deep learning algorithms while also allowing designers to communicate abstractly with design software.},

The restoration project of a seventeenth century sundial at Lerma (Spain) with incorrect engraved marks for the hour lines and devoid of its gnomon raised the issue of whether it is possible to predict what might be the reading errors when providing a new gnomon for it. Moreover, the analysis of possible slight changes in gnomon{\textquoteright}s orientation and/or geometrical features to get better precisions was an appealing challenge. We must consider that Lerma{\textquoteright}s case is not unique: templates were used in the past to engrave marks in numerous dials, and small differences in orientation were not taken into account. Differences in latitude under 0.5{\textdegree} were also neglected, by rounding off to integer values. Although Lerma{\textquoteright}s sundial has been our guiding thread and its results are presented in detail, the method can be extrapolated to calculate reading errors for any dials with wrong marks for orientation or latitude different form the actual ones.},

abstract = {As being living organism, cities can be influenced by social, physical, economic or politic changes occured in urban areas in time. If those changes affect the city in a negative way, urban patterns are not able to fulfill its previous functions and gradually it might result in decaying period. In order to solve this urban problem, urban rehabilitation projects have been used for years. This concept has been widely studied especially in European countries after the II.World War whereas it has gained importance in Turkey after 1980s. At first, urban rehabilitation projects were dealt with economic and physical concerns. However, after confronting the negative outcomes in social structure, it is understood that those projects should also be prepared regarding to social concerns. Thus, European countries have started to use an integrative approach for urban rehabilitation projects by combining social, physical, and economic aspects and to investigate the relationship between socially sustainable societies and urban rehabilitation practices. However, the social concerns of urban rehabilitation projects are not fully considered in Turkey. During the projects, local inhabitants of the area might be forced to leave the rehabilitation are which resulted in the loss of urban identity in time. Urban rehabilitation projects have significant impacts on protecting both historical environments and cultural heritages. In addition to that, strategically organised rehabilitation projects can help to create more sustainable environments not only for current public use, but also for the next generations. For this reason, this study aims to highlight the importance of urban rehabilitation processes especially in historical cities which helps to promote the sustainable urban redevelopment in the longer term. The study consist of four different parts: In the first part, the aim, context and methodology of this study is explained. In this study, it is aimed to investigate a socially sustainable approach to urban renewal projects occurred in Turkey. For this aim, after researching about the theoretical background of the issue, structured interviews are conducted in the case study area of Ortahisar, Trabzon in order to measure social sustainability of the urban rehabilitation project area. The data from those interviews are used to create a evaluation form to create more socially sustainable neighbourhoods in Ortahisar. Later, this form is asked to score by 1-5 by the local people and professional experts like architects, landscape architects, planners. Their scores give the idea of the factors that can create~more socially sustainable urban neighbourhood after the rehabilitation project in Ortahisar. In the second part, the previous studies from literature is analysed. For this purpose, first of all previously prepared studies are examined in order to understand the concept of social sustainability in urban rehabilitation projects. After explaining the term urban renewal, its components and different methods, the definition and evolution of social sustainability concept are explained. Later, the relationships between urban rehabilitation projects and social sustainability issues, tools and the critical factors for measuring social sustainability of an urban rehabilitation projects are discussed in the second part. Moreover, two case studies from the world {\textendash}which are Rotterdam, Holland and East Leipzig, Germany- are examined in detail in terms of their approach to social sustainable issue. The methods used in those case study areas are helpful for shaping an outline for the critical factors that affect social sustainability and their measurement tools. In the following part, the case study area from Trabzon, Turkey is analysed starting from the urban development of the city and the current situation. The case study area of Ortahisar neighbourhood is the historic city centre of old Trabzon city. Thus, it is full of historic architectural structures which are one of the most important cultural heritage of the city. Thus, this part of city is aimed to revitalize in order to create more attractive secondary city centre and a new focal point for the tourists in terms of an urban rehabilitation projects. But it is still unknown whether this project can provide the social sustainability of the area or not. For this reason, it is investigated in that part of the study. In order to achieve this aim, first of all some physical analyses are conducted in the area which are followed by demographic analyses to give an idea about the social structure of the neighbourhood. Later, structured interviews are done with 150 local people who are whether living in the neighbourd or working there. These interviews are aimed to measure the satisfaction level of the local people, their awareness and expectation from the project, their demographic background etc. Those data are used to create a social sustainability list containing critical afctors for achieving a more socially sustainable neighbourhood in Ortahisar. This form is asked 50 experts and 150 local people to not only compare their attitudes, but also find an acceptable criteria. In the end, the overall evaluation of the study is carried out. The comparison of the attitude in the world and in Turkey is done in terms of social sustainability criterias and some suggestions are made for the case study areas in Ortahisar, Trabzon for creating a more socially sustainable urban neighbourhood after the urban rehabilitation project. In short, it can be said that social sustainability of a neighbourhood can be achieved by some critical sustainability indicators and tools. After implementing on-site analyses and observations in Ortahisar neighbourhood, the level of social sustainability of the case study area is investigated. In terms of the outcomes of structured interviews, the most important factor in Ortahisar neighbourhood to provide social sustainability is the quality of urban places which is followed by~demographical factors, public participation, social cohesion and harmony, proprietorial factors, education and employment. According to the results of this study, the social sustainability of Ortahisar neighbourhood can be improved by considering those critical factors. Moreover, it is suggested to measure the social sustainability level of the neighbourhood not only for a single time, but in a constant way to be able to observe the social change in the society. This study is a pilot study which is highlighting the importance of social sustainability in urban rehabilitation projects in Trabzon. It also makes several suggestions to improve the social sustainability of the historic urban environment in Ortahisar. It is hoped that this study will be helpful to achieve socially sustainable urban rehabilitation projects which aims not only to conserve historical heritage sites, but also to satisfy people's needs.},

Shape grammars are the formalism proposed to systematize the design rules required for such a system. A shape grammar for Alvaro Siza's patio houses at Malagueira, a 1200-unit development still being designed and constructed today, is presented. The grammar is based on the corpus of thirty-five houses designed between 1977 and 1996. The generation of houses in the grammar proceeds by the recursive dissection of rectangles locating four different functional zones (patio, living, services, and sleeping) and the key placement of the staircase. The schematic generations of two existing houses and the detailed generation of a novel one illustrate the grammar.},

The objective of sequencing the optimization model is both to minimize overtime and to maximize patients' satisfaction about the assigned time. A real-life case study from a hospital that offers comprehensive surgical procedures for all surgical specialties is considered for illustration. Research results showed that the proposed models efficiently scheduled and sequenced patients while considering their preferences and hospitals operating costs. In conclusion, the proposed optimization models may result in improving patient satisfaction, utilizing hospital's resources efficiently, and providing assistance to decision makers and planners in solving effectively fuzzy scheduling and sequencing problems of operating rooms.},

A proper problem statement is the key to effective problem-solving. Based on the characteristics of the product design process, we divided design problem statements into open-ended (OE), decision-making (DM), and constrained (CO) statements and attempted to investigate the influences of different problem statements on designers' cognitive behaviors from three perspectives, namely divergent thinking, convergent thinking, and mental workload. Then we provided quantification description to these influences based on electroencephalography (EEG) technology. We conducted experiments on 19 participants and used the BrainProduct{\texttrademark} actiChamp-32 to record the EEG data. Results are as follows: (1) The higher task-related $\alpha$ power was found in the temporal and occipital regions in the OE task compared with that in the DM and CO tasks. The OE statement also would help designers get novel ideas by strengthening their divergent thinking. (2) In the DM and CO tasks, there was no significant difference in the impact of the brain region on convergent thinking, but activities in the left hemisphere were stronger than that in the right hemisphere. The DM and CO tasks have better performance in convergent thinking than the OE task. (3) In the CO task, the designer's mental workload is the highest and mainly related to the activation of the centroparietal and occipital regions. These findings help designers understand the design problem-solving process from the perspective of cognitive science and monitor their thinking modes in the design process so as to improve their design performance.},

Using the Mixed Architectural Robotic Interface as a mixture of different software and hardware platforms, ranging from design/modeling software, simulation engine, and an augmented reality application, the designer would be able to evaluate the possibilities/limitations of the fabrication, in real time and as part of the design. This method advances designer{\textquoteright}s understanding of the fabrication equipment as an input for the design decision-making process. This article demonstrates the potential of a virtual/actual hybridized platform as a new medium to design, simulate, and evaluate, in order to enhance the digital design and fabrication. Introducing the possibility of real-time communication between the digital design software and the fabrication platforms as well as the augmented reality simulation of the fabrication process, the Mixed Architectural Robotic Interface enables designers to test the fabrication process with the fabrication equipment in the early stages of the design process. This method makes it possible to move beyond the traditional limitations of machines pursuing {\textquotedblleft}un-expected creativity,{\textquotedblright} without any additional time or cost for the process. Using the virtual material for fabrication, the Mixed Architectural Robotic Interface reduces the time and cost of having multiple iterations and encourages the hands-on experimental use of the fabrication tool (in this article robotic/computer numeric control milling) not only as a production tool but also as a design study tool.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Kim Williams Books, Turin. Despite the evident advantages of combining masonry with prestress, their joint use has been poorly exploited during the last decades. This paper claims the high potential of masonry as a primary load-bearing material when combined with post-tensioning. This work deals with arch footbridges and antifunicular structures. With respect to the first, this research illustrates the introduction of external loads by internal post-tensioning to favourably increase the axial forces in a masonry arch, and consequently improving its structural behaviour. With respect to the second, this work shows how bending moments in a non-funicular 2D curved geometry can be eliminated through an external post-tensioning system. In summary, this research strongly expands the range of post-tensioned masonry structures that exhibit a bending-free (or quasi bending-free) behaviour and, de facto, opens up new possibilities for designs that combine structural efficient solutions with traditional materials.},

This drastically advances traditional procedural city modelling where usually low-level implementations of city model components take place.

The concept of Takagi{\textendash}Landsberg{\textquoteright}s fractal surface is applied in this paper for constructing a parametric model of a hyperbolic paraboloid (hypar) shell structure using the Midpoint Displacement Method (MDM) based on the Iterated Function System (IFS) and controlled by the relative size value (w), a factor of fractal dimension. This method of generating a parametric model of a hypar is applied to create a domain of non-integer dimensions through which the hypar surface passes through textural changes, thus transforming the smooth hypar surface from its two-dimensional shape to a higher but non-integer-dimensional irregular surface that results in the changes of structural behavior. This paper briefly compares the structural behavior between the regular hypar and the fractal-based irregular hypar, and also searches the optimal shape of the hypar in terms of minimum deformation from the collection of its regular version and its different levels of irregular versions.},

abstract = {This thesis proposes a process of providing mass-customized housing based on computer-aided design and production systems. It focuses on the design part, which mainly consists of an interactive system for the generation of design solutions based on a mathematical model called discursive grammar. A discursive grammar includes a shape grammar, a description grammar, and a set of heuristics. The shape grammar provides the rules of formal composition, whereas the description grammar describes the design from other relevant viewpoints. The set of heuristics is used to guide the generation of designs by comparing the description of the evolving design with the description of the desired house. The generation of a design proceeds first by producing a design brief from the user-prompted requirements and then by finding a solution that satisfies this brief. Search is largely deterministic, which decreases the amount of time required to find a solution, thereby making it reasonable to develop Web-based implementations. The proposed model enables an enduring designer's dream, that of the mass customization of housing. The model is illustrated with a case study that includes a shape grammar developed for the houses designed by the architect Alvaro Siza at Malagueira, a description grammar based on the Portuguese housing regulations, and a set of heuristics inferred after a set of experiments. In these experiments, designers were asked to generate houses based on the Malagueira grammar for specific clients. It is argued that this discursive grammar provides a rigorous method for understanding and teaching Siza's design process and that similar grammars could be developed for other styles. A Web page for explaining the grammar and generating new designs on-line was developed as a prototype.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} Cambridge University Press 2018. In the product design realm, designers often use presentations to convey certain ideas about a product or a specific stage of the design process. The popular forms of presentation include verbal pitching, two-dimensional drawing, and prototyping. The clients, investigators, and other audiences rely on such presentations to evaluate an idea. Popular idea evaluation assessment tools, such as the consensual assessment technique, utilize such interactions. On the other hand, numerous pieces of literature state that the audiences are heavily influenced by the quality of presentation when evaluating the worth of the product being presented. In this study, we examine if the audience is able to discriminate between the quality of the presentation and the quality of the idea being presented. A total of 613 ideas were evaluated over a 4-year period during a specific product design class at different phases in the design process. The result shows that no matter the kind of presentation tool used, the presentation quality ratings and the idea value ratings had a very strong positive correlation despite the explicit instructions to reviewers to separate presentation quality from concept quality. Our additional analysis shows that such a pattern did not change during the different phases of the design process.},

The aim of this paper is to investigate the challenges associated with the industrial implementation of generative design systems. Though many studies have been aimed at validating either the technical feasibility or the usefulness of generative design systems, there is, however, a lack of research on the practical implementation and adaptation in industry. To that end, this paper presents two case studies conducted while developing design systems for industrial uses. The first case study focuses on an engineering design application and the other on an industrial design application. In both cases, the focus is on detail-oriented performance-driven generative design systems based on currently available computer-assisted design tools. The development time and communications with the companies were analyzed to identify challenges in the two projects. Overall, the results show that the challenges are not related to whether the design tools are intended for artistic or technical problems, but rather in how to make the design process systematic. The challenges include aspects such as how to fully utilize the potential of generative design tools in a traditional product development process, how to enable designers not familiar with programming to provide design generation logic, and what should be automated and what is better left as a manual task. The paper suggests several strategies for dealing with the identified challenges.},

abstract = {Shortly after shape grammars were invented by Stiny and Gips, a two part project for shape grammars was outlined by Stiny. In a 1976 paper,1 Stiny described "two exercises in formal composition". These simple exercises became the foundation for the many applications of shape grammars that followed, and suggested the potential of such applications in education and practice. The first exercise showed how shape grammars could be used in original composition, that is, the creation of new design languages or styles from scratch. The second exercise showed how shape grammars could be used to analyze known or existing design languages. Both exercises illustrated the unique characteristics of the shape grammar formalism that helped motivate a quarter century (almost!) of shape grammar work. General but simple, formal yet intuitive: qualities that continue to make shape grammar disciples and confound skeptics. The history of shape grammar applications in architecture and the arts for the two complementary purposes of synthesis and analysis, as well as for a third, joint purpose is sketched in the first section of this report. These three categories of applications do not have rigid boundaries. They are used in this report mostly as a framework for discussion. An overview of the roles of shape grammar applications in education and practice is given in the second section. New and ongoing issues concerning shape grammars in education and practice are discussed in the last section.},

Numerous examples of cuboctahedra found in medieval-era buildings whose dates range from the early twelfth to the early fifteenth century across in Turkey indicate the significant use of such geometrical entities. Here we focus particularly on cuboctahedra with carved-out surfaces. The results show that although the unit cell, which is a combination of cubes and tetrahedra, sufficiently explains all examples, the octahemioctahedron and stella octangula strengthen the possibility of tetrahedral packing with its dual network and indicate a {\textquotedblleft}vector matrix{\textquotedblright}, as suggested by R. Buckminster Fuller. Therefore, their prevalent use as a {\textquotedblleft}geometric solid{\textquotedblright} in a hollow cube frame and their appearance as an envelope of either tetrahedral packing or highly complex surfaces reveal almost 800-hundred-year-old examples of cuboctahedra as a Vector Equilibrium (VE) producing Isotropic Vector Matrix (IVM).},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} Cambridge University Press 2017. Biologically inspired design can be used to aid in conceptual design. Sketching is an important ideation process in conceptual design for recording and evaluating flashing moments of inspiration. The present study aims to provide a framework for exploring the effects of biological examples on the sketching contours of products, as well as the perceptual matching degree between design ideas generated via sketching and the desired functions. Elliptic Fourier descriptors with principal component analysis and perceptual matching were used to evaluate and compare the effects of biological examples, no examples, and human-engineered examples from different product categories and within one product category on the sketches in an experiment that involved 28 participants. The application of elliptic Fourier descriptors with principal component analysis shows that there are significant differences in the third and seventh principal components. It is also found that exposure to biological examples can produce more sketches with high perceptual matching degree than the other three conditions, but there are no significant effects of the example exposure on the Pearson correlation coefficients of semantic differential evaluation value vectors between design problems and sketches. These results demonstrate that exposure to biological examples will correlate with Elliptic Fourier descriptors of sketches and will not significantly increase the perceptual matching degree between sketches and the desired function.},

This article contains a first metrological analysis of the Late Roman Fort of Umm al-Dabadib, built at the beginning of the 4th century AD at the outskirts of the Kharga Oasis, in the Egyptian Western Desert. This site is currently under study by the Italian Archaeological Mission to Umm al-Dabadib; after completing the 3D survey of the building, the team moved to the study of its dimensional patterns. The resulting 3D model was tested for the use of Roman and Egyptian units of measurement, and revealed that the building was planned and built according to the Egyptian Reformed Cubit. The Fort of Umm al-Dabadib, therefore, currently represents the latest attestation of the use of the Egyptian cubit in architecture.},

We present Tangible Landscape{\textemdash}a technology for rapidly and intuitively designing landscapes informed by geospatial modeling, analysis, and simulation. It is a tangible interface powered by a geographic information system that gives three-dimensional spatial data an interactive, physical form so that users can naturally sense and shape it. Tangible Landscape couples a physical and a digital model of a landscape through a real-time cycle of physical manipulation, three-dimensional scanning, spatial computation, and projected feedback. Natural three-dimensional sketching and real-time analytical feedback should aid landscape architects in the design of high performance landscapes that account for physical and ecological processes. We conducted a series of studies to assess the effectiveness of tangible modeling for landscape architects. Landscape architecture students, academics, and professionals were given a series of fundamental landscape design tasks{\textemdash}topographic modeling, cut-and-fill analysis, and water flow modeling. We assessed their performance using qualitative and quantitative methods including interviews, raster statistics, morphometric analyses, and geospatial simulation. With tangible modeling, participants built more accurate models that better represented morphological features than they did with either digital or analog hand modeling. When tangibly modeling, they worked in a rapid, iterative process informed by real-time geospatial analytics and simulations. With the aid of real-time simulations, they were able to quickly understand and then manipulate how complex topography controls the flow of water.},

These algorithms were benchmarked against 13,000 actual offices designed by human architects. The algorithm performed as well as an architect on 77% of offices, and achieved a higher capacity in an additional 6%, all while following a set of space standards. If the algorithm used the space standards the same way as an architect (a more relaxed interpretation), the algorithm achieved a 97% match rate, which means that the algorithm completed this design task as well as a designer and in a shorter time. The benchmarking of a layout algorithm against thousands of existing designs is a novel contribution of this article, and we argue that it might be a first step toward a more comprehensive method to automate parts of the office layout process.},

The first challenge is the representation of shapes, which needs to enable reinterpretation of parts regardless of the creation history of the shapes. The second challenge is the relevant part searching algorithm that provides an extensive exploration of the design space-time efficiently. In this work, we propose a novel method to solve both problems; we treat shapes as they are and use a parallel particle swarm optimization-based algorithm to compute emergent parts. The execution time of the proposed method is improved substantially by dividing the search space into small parts and carrying out searches in each part concurrently using a graphics processing unit. The experiments show that the proposed implementation detects emergent parts accurately and time efficiently.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} Cambridge University Press 2017. If a solvable problem is currently unsolved, then something important to a solution is most likely being overlooked. From this simple observation we derive the obscure features hypothesis: every innovative solution is built upon at least one commonly overlooked or new (i.e., obscure) feature of the problem. By using a new definition of a feature as an effect of an interaction, we are able to accomplish five things. First, we are able to determine where features come from and how to search for new ones. Second, we are able to construct mathematical arguments that the set of features of an object is not computably enumerable. Third, we are able to characterize innovative problem solving as looking for a series of interactions that produce the desired effects (i.e., the goal). Fourth, we are able to construct a precise problem-solving grammar that is both human and machine friendly. Fifth, we are able to devise a visual and verbal problem-solving representation that both humans and computers can contribute to as they help counteract each other's problem-solving weaknesses. We show how computers can counter some of the known cognitive obstacles to innovation that humans have. We also briefly discuss ways in which humans can return the favor. We conclude that a promising process for innovative problem solving is a human-computer collaboration in which each partner assists the other in unearthing the obscure features of a problem.},

This article presents the 'Roman City Ruleset', a suite of procedural rules for creating 3D models of Roman and Hellenistic architecture and urban environments. Unlike traditional 3D modeling software, in which the user directly manipulates polygons to simulate form, procedural modeling entails the use of computer programming languages to write a semantic description of a building that then generates a polygonal model. Procedural modeling has the potential to address a number of issues related to 3D archaeological reconstructions which are of concern to digital humanists. Of particular interest for archaeologists and architectural historians is the ability to test hypothetical reconstructions of ancient architecture in a fully realized urban context. The procedural rules link each iteration of a model to its source material, allowing the degree of certainty present in each model to be accurately defined through the documentation of each step in the process of interpreting a given data set. Procedural modeling enhances the scholarly value of architectural reconstructions by providing a platform for the comparison and refutation of 3D visualizations, and advances the methodology of 3D modeling toward becoming an essential part of the digital humanist's toolkit.},

Design problems are often presented as structured briefs with detailed constraints and requirements, suggesting a fixed definition. However, past studies have identified the importance of exploring design problems for creative design outcomes. Previous protocol studies of designers has shown that problems can co-evolve with the development of solutions during the design process. But to date, little evidence has been provided about how designers systematically explore presented problems to create better solutions. In this study, we conducted a qualitative analysis of 252 design problems collected from publically available sources, including award-winning product designs and open-source design competitions. This database offers an independent sample of presented problems, designers' alternative problem descriptions, and innovative solutions. We report the results of this large-scale qualitative analysis aimed at characterizing changes to problems during the design process. Inductive coding was used to identify content patterns in discovered problem descriptions, with qualitative codes reliably scored by two independent coders. A total of 32 distinct patterns of problem exploration were identified across designers and presented problems. Each pattern is described in the form of a generalized strategy to guide designers as they explore problem spaces. The exploration patterns identified in this study are the first empirical evidence of problem exploration in independent design problems.

abstract = {The output of interdisciplinary research is unexpected that one particular field cannot reach with his/her own expertise. In traditional architectural workflow, computational tools associated with performance simulation are utilized during the later stage of the design process following the concept design. However, this reduces the efficiency by alterations of the conceptual model. Based on the fact that material, form and performance aspects of design can be integrated together, by specifying their parameters, rules and relationships as observed in natural systems, a Material-based Integrated Computational Design Model (MICD-m) in architecture is developed combining architectural design with biology, material science, mathematics, mechanical engineering, structural engineering and computer science for the early stage use in architectural design. A custom-designed user interface, database and reports are included in the MICD-m, designed as a plug-in for a 3D geometric modelling tool. The MICD-m is tested with a case study in parametric modelling environment.},

Research on artificial intelligence focuses mainly on image-, text- and voice-based applications, leading to breakthrough developments in self-driving cars, voice recognition algorithms and recommendation systems. In this article, we present the research of an alternative graph-based machine learning system that deals with three-dimensional space, which is more structured and combinatorial than images, text or voice. Specifically, we present a function-driven deep learning approach to generate conceptual design. We trained and used deep neural networks to evaluate existing designs encoded as graphs, extract significant building blocks as subgraphs and merge them into new compositions. Finally, we explored the application of generative adversarial networks to generate entirely new and unique designs.},

The interpreter is general, is three-dimensional, and supports subshape detection. A grammar is a Rhinoceros3d model; thus users can manipulate all its parts directly and immediately. That is, they can modify any shape without selecting or invoking an editor, and they can lay out the parts of the grammar in any way they find meaningful. Using this approach, which I call a whole-grammar approach, users are shielded from most subdomain tasks, like typing text files or specifying transformations.

However, it also serves as the origin of our proposition that the objectives of the TNA method are better served within a Mesh Modelling Environment (MME).

The past 15 years have been characterised by constant technological and digital innovations, and, as a consequence, computer science has evolved past its academic and elitist status to become the common language adopted by professionals in many fields, revolutionising the methods and tools, and even creating new industries and markets. This shift permeated the architectural and construction industry, dramatically influencing the form and function of modern buildings. Stereotomy, one of the most fascinating and complex techniques in the history of pre-modern architecture, captures best the potential of being able to use digital design to integrate architectural form, structural integrity and environmental performance in a single multi-performative {\textquotedblleft}skin{\textquotedblright}. The intention of the following text is to highlight some application of new digital technologies in real life projects that fundamentally have a close link to the traditional stereotomic principles of {\textquotedblleft}solid cutting{\textquotedblright} (Fallacara and Barberio in Handbook of research on form and morphogenesis in modern architectural contexts.

These strategies overlap architectural design and dance choreography to explore reciprocal exchanges regarding the body, geometry and methods of spatial notation. Analogue and digital notational systems are compared to illustrate a change where the notation is fed back to the performer and used as inspiration for further iterative performances. Whilst the use of analogue notation systems supports the criterion of fundamental design, they have limitations which are overcome with the use of flexible digital systems that more readily adapt to change and interrelate to a dancer{\textquoteright}s intentions for movement creation. Performance-driven fabrication explores the practical application of this process. Two stages of {\textquoteleft}Performance-driven design{\textquoteright} and {\textquoteleft}Data-driven fabrication{\textquoteright} are combined, resulting in a spatial design and construction system that incorporates interactivity between human and robotic performers.},

Combining graph-based parametric design with metaheuristic solvers has to date focused solely on performance-based criteria and solving clearly defined objectives. In this article, we outline a new method for combining a parametric modelling environment with an interactive Cluster-Orientated Genetic Algorithm. In addition to performance criteria, evolutionary design exploration can be guided through choice alone, with user motivation that cannot be easily defined. As well as numeric parameters forming a genotype, the evolution of whole parametric definitions is discussed through the use of genetic programming. Visualisation techniques that enable mixing small populations for interactive evolution with large populations for performance-based optimisation are discussed, with examples from both academia and industry showing a wide range of applications.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Kim Williams Books, Turin. As we know, the aim of architectural design is the materialization of space, a process that we will attempt to comprehend in the mode that the Rietveld-Schr{\"o}eder House was built, especially because the house was raised on a privileged plot with three sides free, which is determined to be the fifth element. However, we should ask why wood was used instead of concrete, why the stair is so peculiar, why the first floor has mobile partitions, why the southeast view is so favored, and why the roof is flat in a place where gable roofs are traditionally used. In addition, the question of whether the house design has particular proportions has been raised. These questions are discussed in this article from the architectural point of view based on Rietveld{\textquoteright}s original drawings of the house.},

When a process change happens for some reason, it is often difficult to identify how many factors are affected and estimate how sensitive these factors can be. To optimize the planning and replanning of the shipbuilding plan for the best production performance, a data-driven approach for shipbuilding erection planning is proposed, which is composed of an erection plan model, identification of major factors related to the erection plan, and a data-driven algorithm to apply shipbuilding operation data for creating plans and forecasting, for plan adjustment, future availabilities of shipyard resources including machines, equipment, and man power. Through data clustering, the relevant factors are identified as a result of plan change, and critical equipment health management is carried out through data-driven anomaly detection. A case study is implemented, and the result shows that the proposed data-driven method is able to reschedule the shipbuilding plans smoothly.},

This paper presents the development of circular-planned diagrid systems in architecture and varying approaches in patents in relation to these developments, together with a technique introduced for producing diagrid implementations using planar elements. A circular plan creates a curved surface at its periphery that leads to the diagrid system on a curved surface, resulting in unique geometric configurations. Patents based on these geometric configurations and their details, registered between 1896 and 2016, are documented. A technique is devised by the authors as a reinterpretation of the diagrid system via planar components with its own parameters and principles. This technique may be utilized by design offices or by the students of architecture for prototyping or modelling a circular-planned diagrid structure in a precise, fast and economical manner by means of conventional CNC manufacturing techniques.},

Architects and historians commonly claim that when designing the Palau G{\"u}ell, Gaud{\'\i} experimented with some architectural elements which would influence his later works, with the arches being prevalent in the building. But, to date, no mathematically thorough study has been conducted in order to determine the type of each of such arches. Furthermore, literature contains subjective and intuitive claims which create ambiguity and contradictions. Owing to the methods used by Gaud{\'\i}, the arches in Palau G{\"u}ell are best fit by conical curves (ellipse, parabola, hyperbola) or hyperbolic-cosine curves (catenary, Rankine). Using photogrammetrical and mathematical techniques, in this paper we will classify the arches of this building according to their types, we will eliminate the inconsistencies which currently exist in literature, and we will obtain the corresponding analytical equations, which may be helpful in future studies.},

The research is classified into seven main areas as follows: {\&} {\#}x02022; Computer-Supported Synchronous Collaborative Design (CSSCD) {\&} {\#}x02022; Design Creativity {\&} {\#}x02022; Evolutionary Models of Design {\&} {\#}x02022; Shape Emergence {\&} {\#}x02022; Design Intent and Multiple Abstractions {\&} {\#}x02022; Integration of Specific and General Knowledge {\&} {\#}x02022; Concept Learning - Machine Learning. While each such area will be discussed separately, there are many interrelations between them. For example, the research on CSSCD includes the research into shape emergence, design intent and multiple abstractions and their integration in the one environment; design creativity includes research into shape emergence and evolutionary models; CSSCD, evolutionary models, design creativity, case-based design and design intent/multiple abstractions all deal with object-oriented or schema-based representations of design objects and classes, using the design prototype schema developed at the then Design Computing Unit (DCU). The work on memory organization for heterogenous design knowledge includes aspects of concept learning and machine learning. Evolutionary models are also seen as an approach to machine learning. All the above areas of research are concerned with producing computable models of design processes based on integrating artificial intelligence approaches with CAD systems to provide better design support for designers using CAD systems. Other areas of research of the KCDC, not described in this paper are design theory and practice. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

Using the arts such as music or utilizing digital mathematics science related to architecture could lead to the creation of special work of art. The aim of this article was to find a relationship between music and architecture and mathematics and the analysis of the parameters of this relationship in traditional Iranian architecture. To answer these questions, this article followed a qualitative research method along with comparative analysis and logical reasoning in theoretical studies and effective parameters. Accordingly, the present study is aimed to investigate the relationships and commonalities between music and architecture and mathematics and the various theoretical approaches in this regard. Then, there is a part studying the similarities between music and architecture and mathematics in traditional Iranian architecture. The results revealed that there is a deep, conceptual, and fundamental connection between music and traditional Iranian architecture the appearance of which is obvious in analysis and investigation of different parameters such as rhythm, high and low, hierarchy, numbers, mathematics, geometry, and color indicating compatibility of two or manifold presence of concept, physics and mathematics. Thus, the connection between parameters of {\textquotedblleft}music-architecture-mathematics{\textquotedblright} relationship in traditional Iranian architecture could be divided to two main approaches. In the conceptual-physical approach, elements such as color, rhythm, music, and high and low are important in traditional architecture.

In this paper, a shape grammar model, which is based on the generative capability of grammar and the reasoning capabilities of knowledge-based systems and their integration in a prototype, is introduced. The model, which operates in a top-down manner, can be described at three levels. At the first level, a vocabulary for an architectural language of row-houses is formed by analysing this type of house syntactically and formally. At the second level, this vocabulary is transformed into a shape grammar. Finally, a syntactic system is defined as a space of possible designs according to these analyses. An interface design has been carried out to facilitate the communication between the users and the model during the design process.},

The hub location problems involve locating facilities and designing hub networks to minimize the total cost of transportation (as a function of distance) between hubs, establishing facilities and demand management. In this paper, we consider the capacitated cluster hub location problem because of its wide range of applications in real-world cases, especially in transportation and telecommunication networks. In this regard, a mathematical model is presented to address this problem under capacity constraints imposed on hubs and transportation lines. Then, a new hybrid algorithm based on simulated annealing and ant colony optimization is proposed to solve the presented problem. Finally, the computational experiments demonstrate that the proposed heuristic algorithm is both effective and efficient.},

A brief historical overview of winter sled sports is made, in which the geometric analysis of tracks, their architectural styles, and land planning compositions are studied. As a recent example of the architecture of sport facilities, the article presents the author{\textquoteright}s original contribution on the bobsleigh track of Sochi, built for the Winter Olympics, 2014.

abstract = {Digital Fabrications, the second volume in our new Architecture Briefs series, celebrates the design ingenuity made possible by digital fabrication techniques. Author Lisa Iwamoto explores the methods architects use to calibrate digital designs with physical forms. The book is organized according to five types of digital fabrication techniques: tessellating, sectioning, folding, contouring, and forming. Projects are shown both in their finished forms and in working drawings, templates, and prototypes, allowing the reader to watch the process of each fantastic construction unfold. Digital Fabrications presents projects designed and built by emerging practices that pioneer techniques and experiment with fabrication processes on a small scale with a do-it-yourself attitude.

The success of these constructions is due to the knowledge of promoters and builders. This study introduces the original sources of the codex of the cathedral of Tortosa (Catalonia, Spain) with authors such as Calcidius, Capella, Macrobius, Al-{\d H}ajj{\=a}j ibn Y{\=u}suf ibn Ma{\d t}ar or Gerbert. The combined assessment of these sources, together with the masonry built and Guarc{\textquoteright}s original plan (c.1345{\textendash}c.1380) shed some light on the mathematical knowledge of the cathedrals{\textquoteright} builders.},

The project starts with the development of a 1~m3 prototype associated to a micro-domestic space for each student, generating forty-five microarchitectures. The main objective for all students is domesticity. Students interpret their domestic intimate space developed in a 1~m3 cube. The aim of this paper is to test the learning process on domestic layout through a prototyping approach. The approach is based on twenty-five previously selected architectural references, and proceeds through a process of co-design learning and design thinking to the translation and experimental approach of ten prototypes constructed at a scale of 1:1. This paper focuses on the learning process carried out with the DPM (diagram, plan, model) methodology and patterns generated by the students{\textquoteright} architectural projects through the development of prototypes.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Cambridge University Press. The use of grammars in design and analysis has been set back by the lack of automated ways to induce them from arbitrarily structured datasets. Machine translation methods provide a construct for inducing grammars from coded data which have been extended to be used for design through pre-coded design data. This work introduces a four-step process for inducing grammars from un-coded structured datasets which can constitute a wide variety of data types, including many used in the design. The method includes: (1) extracting objects from the data, (2) forming structures from objects, (3) expanding structures into rules based on frequency, and (4) finding rule similarities that lead to consolidation or abstraction. To evaluate this method, grammars are induced from generated data, architectural layouts and three-dimensional design models to demonstrate that this method offers usable grammars automatically which are functionally similar to grammars produced by hand.},

This speculative essay examines a single drawing, produced in a collaboration between the authors and a Turtle robot, in a search for methods to evaluate and document provenance in artificial intelligence and robotic design. Reflecting upon the layers of authorship in our case study reveals the complex relationship that already exists between human and machine collaborators. In response to this unseen provenance, we propose new modes to document the full range of creative contribution to the design and production of artifacts from intellectual inputs to digital representations to physical labor. A more comprehensive system for artificial intelligence/robotic attribution could produce counter-narratives to technological development which more fully acknowledge the contributions of both humans and machines.

abstract = {In the mythic construct of the West, nature, for a considerable era, has served as a seminal broker in basal underpinning discourse. This is despite nature's commutative, convertible and contradictory
disclosures. As the antithesis of socio-culture, nature has been the arena of the given, of necessity and compulsion, and a zone of constraint. As "Nature" it has worked as the precipitate of humanity and ministered as the model for human activity. To violate the norms of nature, to be unnatural, has
been considered unhealthy, amoral and illegal.
Following the Second World War, constructs of nature, socio-culture and norms were altered in design education and practice. Postwar, an emerging discourse of computer-related technologies contributed to reconfiguring representations of architecture, engineering, product and urban planning in the US and UK. The collective driving these changes became known as the Design Methods movement. Together with trajectories of thought in psychology and psychiatry, discourses materializing from such fields as cybernetics, operations research, information theory and computers altered design processes and education.
This dissertation ranges from examining the politics of funding surrounding an urban planning research center in Cambridge, Massachusetts to elucidating conferences concerning, architecture, engineering, urban planning and product design in the UK. Taking from media theorist Friedrich Kittler that technologically possible manipulations condition what can become a discourse, this dissertation is structured around two threads. One thread concerns how computer-related technologies configured a re-conceptualization of nature and socio-culture in design practice and education. A second thread examines how psychology and psychoanalytic concerns were reworked for design through a lens of computer related technologies. A line between the natural and the normative is questioned concerning concepts of abnormality and deviation.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Kim Williams Books, Turin. Stereotomy is historically synonymous with stone construction and solid architectural poch{\'e}. Yet stereotomy need not be limited to dense materials and compression-only structural forms. With the aim of developing stereotomic architecture that employs parts that are exceptionally expressive{\textemdash}rather than exceptionally heavy{\textemdash}this paper explores constructions made from glass-fiber reinforced plastic, a contemporary lightweight material. The research also recognizes that the volumetric parts and networks of joints employed for stereotomy have important visual as well as physical consequences. By focusing on creative applications of descriptive geometry, the projects presented in this paper seek to make explicit stereotomy{\textquoteright}s unique combination of graphic and constructional qualities. Using a novel system of tessellations derived from digital simulations, the research puts computational techniques in service of stereotomy{\textquoteright}s formal questions, developing visually animated assemblies of parts. The architectural qualities of these assemblies as well as the constructional feasibility of lightweight stereotomic parts were tested through a series of designs that culminated in large architectural constructions, including a free-standing wall, a pavilion prototype and a free-standing interior pavilion employing lightweight, free-form Cyclopean masonry.},

abstract = {Computer games often take place in extensive virtual worlds, attractive for roaming and exploring. Unfortunately, current virtual cities can strongly hinder this kind of gameplay, since the buildings they feature typically have replicated interiors, or no interiors at all. Procedural content generation is becoming more established, with many techniques for automatically creating specific building elements. However, the integration of these techniques to form complete buildings is still largely unexplored, limiting their application to open game worlds. We propose a novel approach that integrates existing procedural techniques to generate such buildings. With minimal extensions, individual techniques can be coordinated to create buildings with consistently interrelated exteriors and interiors, as in the real world. Our solution offers a framework where various procedural techniques communicate with a moderator, which is responsible for negotiating the placement of building elements, making use of a library of semantic classes and constraints. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by presenting several examples featuring the integration of a fa{\&}{\#}x00E7;ade shape grammar, two different floor plan layout generation techniques, and furniture placement techniques. We conclude that this approach allows one to preserve the individual qualities of existing procedural techniques, while assisting the consistency maintenance of the generated buildings.},

abstract = {<div class="abstract" data-abstract-type="normal"><p>Information technologies are a driving force for progress in the design field, allowing new modes of creativity. However, most of the existing computational design tools are focused on the latest stages of the design process and especially directed to drafting operations. Conceptual design tools that support the designer in the creative and inventive early stages of the design project are still in their early development. Shape grammars (SG) were introduced by George Stiny in the 1970s, allowing the generation of designs according to a set of predefined rules. SG computational implementations have the potential to answer the need for tools that can assist designers, architects, and artists in the creative process, offering design alternatives, stimulating new ideas and encouraging the search for new design generation processes. Acknowledging this potential, a user-friendly interface seems essential for the adoption of these tools. Taking Scott Chase's interaction model as background, the aim of the present investigation is to define guidelines and begin to design a graphical-user interface for SG implementations. Inspection methods of human{\textendash}computer interaction (HCI) were used to analyze existing SG implementations and understand usability issues. Subsequently, HCI ergonomic criteria for interface evaluation were adapted to establish guidelines for the design of an SG implementation interface, called IM-sqi. These guidelines take into account different user groups, adjustable interaction modes for each user group, and the nature of each task performed by the user.</p></div>},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Cambridge University Press. This paper presents a multipurpose chair grammar and its implementation in the design tool ChairDNA. This tool is oriented for the exploration of design alternatives in the early concept phase of the chair design process. This work addresses two shortcomings within the research area of shape grammars (SGs), namely, the lack of implementation of SGs applied to design domains, and the lack of practical applications in real-life design scenarios. To address these problems, a methodology is proposed for the implementation of a SG (more specifically, a set grammar) into a tool, comprising the translation of the grammar into user-interface elements oriented for design practitioners. By using the proposed tool, the user can add/delete chair components and edit shape parameters, while visualizing the effects on a three-dimensional digital model presented in a variety of CAD applications. Compared with other SG implementations, ChairDNA uses an approach that keeps under control the combinatorial explosion of rule applications, which simplifies the use of the tool by designers that do not have experience in SGs. The generative potential of the tool is demonstrated by generating chairs of different types, and its usability and utility in aiding the designer are evaluated by design students and design practitioners.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Cambridge University Press. Shape grammars have been developed to codify a specific type of artifact - Queen Anne houses, Buffalo bungalows - or the style of a particular designer - Andrea Palladio, Frank Lloyd Wright, or {\'A}lvaro Siza Vieira. However, these specific grammars fail to encode recurrent design moves or features that are above the particularities of a specific design style or the idiosyncrasies of a specific designer and, therefore, are common to a larger category of designs and maybe reutilized and incorporated in the definition of new, specific design languages. To overcome these limitations, the notion of generic grammars for defining design domains is introduced. Its application to the urban design domain is illustrated by showing a generic grammar implementation resulting in a City Information Modeling platform composed of a parametric design interface connected to a geographic database.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Copyright Cambridge University Press 2018. This paper proposes to contribute to our understanding of the fundamental cognitive processes essential to designing by exploring the experiences of people who have different information processing behaviors to those found in most people. In particular, we focus on people with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) because they are known to have information processing behaviors that are both maladaptive and exceptional. Central to our study is the question: what can we learn from people with ASC about cognitive processes essential to designing? The scholarship on cognitive behaviors associated with the autism spectrum and narratives on the experiences with design practice by individuals with ASC are discussed in relation to cognitive processes associated with designing. In turn, the individuals commented upon the analysis of cognitive processes associated with designing in light of their personal experiences with design practice. We conclude that the weak central coherence theory of autism provides a useful prediction of the cognitive processes necessary for expertise in design, and that both the framework for expertise in design and the way it is studied may require updating.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Kim Williams Books, Turin. Contemporary innovations in structural form-finding and fabrication techniques are leading to design of freeform masonry architecture. These new forms create new challenges in laying out tessellation patterns, especially if structural, fabrication and construction requirements as well as aesthetical considerations are taken into account. Addressing these challenges, we review historic stone-cutting strategies and their geometric principles, forming the base for the development of two new discretisation approaches for given thrust surfaces, allowing for various degrees of user control. First, we introduce a tessellation approach based on primal, anisotropic triangular meshes and their dual counterparts. Second, an alternative tessellation approach based on transverse cutting curves is presented. Using a simple set of geometric rules, both methods enable the design of rigid, staggered bonds with locally force-flow aligned block configurations to avoid sliding failures. For this research, the tessellation design of the Armadillo Vault, an unreinforced, dry-assembled, cut-stone stone shell, served as a case study to demonstrate the feasibility of our methods in the context of a full-scale architectural project.},

Ontology is a formal representation of a set of domain concepts and their relationships. The use of analogy and ontology in design activities to support design creativity have previously been explored. This paper explores an approach to construct ontologies with sufficient richness and coverage to support reasoning over real-world datasets for prompting creative idea generation. This approach has been implemented into a computational tool for assisting designers in generating creative ideas during the early stages of design. The tool, called the Retriever, has been developed based on ontology by embracing the aspects of analogical reasoning. A case study has indicated that the tool can be effective and useful for idea generation. The results have indicated that the tool, in its current formulation, can significantly improve the fluency and flexibility of idea generation and the usefulness of ideas, as well as slightly increase the originality of ideas, for the case study concerned.},

abstract = {People since ages in order to meet different requirements of various space ~have embarked on a search. This basically human actions in their own quest for space accommodates. In shaping the nature of space in a variety of human needs and requests plays an important role. This configuration gives the determinants of physical, cultural phenomena or may be living habits. Places, shaped in accordance with the principles set according to the needs of people makes sense. This is for a variety of actions depending on the requirements to places with different functions are needed. In the first ages, which means exchange of goods trade concept has always been a part of human life. Trade concept has changed in parallel to the development in human life. Hand in their cars or outdoor areas open markets that have been made to this action series, over time, the community requirements, in parallel with economic and technological developments have been moved indoors. With the change of community life in commercial buildings' architectural and spatial fiction began to form. Thus, together with the changing commercial structure designed spaces to spaces of shopping action changed by showing the development of today's IDs. Shopping, in human history not only take the necessary relief, but also characterized as a social action. Therefore, shopping store design is important. Shops generally, offers similar product types, that they are stores in its inside consumer walk around, analyze, try and buy products. Shop with us today are classified according to selling goods to species and to their position. In designing a shopping venue, the magazine of the interior and facade design has an important role. Firstly, in shop{\textquoteright}s interior design sold product and nature of the product is determined. Then according to product, the design concept of the shop is emerged. Depending on their potential consumer and shop design rules are created.~ Shops, fashion and trends, also according to consumer demand is constantly changing places. Of course, this change is carried out in the framework of a specific design pattern. If the scope of the thesis as it would complicate the program that produced only clothing store focused on. Example models of plan schemes produced in this study being questioned, also created algorithm is measured in the first phase of the design the convenience it provides. In grammar-based design method, the relationship between forms, design builder is the basic idea. These relationships not only can be constructed based on the geometry of pure form, but also the form can be edited according to the meaning given to. Form selection and determination of the relationship between forms is determined by design problems, program and designer{\textquoteright}s review. The conventional design methods affect in the same way computer-aided design factors of design and this will impact on the design process, computer-aided design tools and designers communication is important. The designer, enter together the chance to intervene in the computer-aided design method of control. The designer handle the chance to check the options as which rule applies where, when, how, and when to start, when it will end. In this way, decisions are provided by the designer, the method of design control and ~flow is directed. The control of these stages, the designer's foresights and intuitions is important. If the designer can predict which can reproduce the forms and software in this direction control, the nature of work and wealth can be increased as well. Rule-based alternatives to replicate both in terms of design, both of which are common characteristics and to obtain different from each other in terms of design provides conveniences. Thanks to computer technology to be transferred to a computer-based design rules and in the use of the rapid developments. Design world in the form of production mechanism, is working by the rules of shape grammar. An important feature of the shape grammar is that it can allows to trace back. So, in order to try out alternatives, has a feature as in its inference to return to the previous form. In shape gramars rules are not expressed a ~symbolic expression, is directly expressed through with shapes. Shape rules can be considered steady answers given to steady states. However, the rules of grammar are not limiting, only are the tools used in creating a way from known to unknown. Shape grammars are provided with two advantageous aspects. The first is a certainty, according to the previous approach to the classification of shapes more perfect way method is followed. The second is a generality, is generally neutral, equal to all styles and focuses on introspective features. Both are attentive and eclectic. In the world of design with the use of the computer as a common, computer logic can be easily adapted to the computer environment that is compatible with the rule-based design methods began to emerge to the fore. Shape grammars is a system of rules for the design language of to define and create spatial compositions. Rule-based design methods is made with the format, which is one of the grammar logic of a design method to analyze; even subtracting the format rules, the rule change, which is sited to the base of the design of the computer environment with the logic of the same design or convert it to possible new designs creation. In this thesis, some shops an example for shop design are examined, analyzed and designed out of the system that produces new plan schemas. In this study, the production of a program that offers alternatives to the abstract background to the designer in early design process. Due to the intensive use of clothing shops, especially in the design of the shop are emphasized. Within the scope of the work, using the power of the computer's calculation, producing over alternative plans focuses on improving the program. In this way, the design process in a short time, the opportunity to work through many plan alternatives is born and it has become an easy examination of large areas. With these alternatives, possible problems that may occur are intended to provide prior and rapid detection. At this point, by applying a small number of rules to be seen a large number of alternative plans targeted, it is intended to make suitable selection of alternatives. In the scope of thesis, enterance, showcase, cash desk, storage ve changing cubicles are shop{\textquoteright}s spatial elements and their settlements are produced alternatively. As a priority, objective of the thesis, the scope and the methodology are discussed. Then the definition of the rule-based systems, properties, application areas and related species are given. Shape grammar with different studies is examined and shape grammar techniques are analyzed. Other section general information about the shop are provided, shop design criteria are described and in this context in the literature survey is conducted. According to the criteria specified in the existing shop designs are analyzed and evaluated. In application section, shape grammar-based design method developed for shop design has been transferred. In early stages of shop design a useable model is produced and the program that works on plan shemas are evaluated. Certain rules and limitations are defined with shape grammar and the resulting sample models are evaluated. The model is applied on studied samples and different design alternatives are produced. Algorithm put into computer-based enviroment with C{\#} software. In the conclusion, objectives for developing the method in the following stages are disclosed obtaining by evaluating the plan schemes. Thanks to model different plan shemes to see and these include comments with respect to the user to select the most appropriate is aimed. Alternatives produced with the help of the computer, so that compared results between each other. Whereby step by step the most appropriate design is selected. This is a interactive model which the designer{\textquoteright}s control is in the foreground. Also model shows efficiency in formation of shape and in user-oriented designs that the guiding was concluded. The program used components, with given many of the rules, generates different rule-based alternative. Some of the results obtained and predictable results expected and some are unexpected results. Unexpected results may lead designer. These results are not used directly, user intervention or even the architect's rendition is capable become available. With the development of recommendations and deepening methods to further reduce the burden of the designer can be achieved. The method followed in the process of shop design is considered successful due to its contribution and the opportunities for rule-based system. This works for all types of shops in the development of plan schemes are expected to contribute.},

The objective of this research is to explore the ability of folded origami tessellations to adapt to free-form surface configurations and to evaluate the structural behavior of these folded tessellations for architectural and engineering applications. A mathematical exploration of the kinematics of folding provides the basis for understanding the relationship between the geometric parameters of the Miura-Ori origami fold pattern and the flexibility of the three-dimensional folded form. The structural behavior of folded plate structures derived from the Miura pattern on an architectural scale is studied in an effort to answer the question: does function follow fold? A parametric workflow provides the platform for evaluating the effect of fold pattern variations on the structural performance of the folded geometry, and computational methods are used to optimize the performance of the structure.},

abstract = {The Logic of Architecture is the first comprehensive, systematic, and modern treatment of the logical foundations of design thinking. It provides a detailed discussion of languages of architectural form, their specification by means of formal grammars, their interpretation, and their role in structuring design thinking.Supplemented by more than 200 original illustrations, The Logic of Architecture reexamines central issues of design theory in the light of recent advances in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and the theory of computation. The richness of this approach permits sympathetic and constructive analysis of positions developed by a wide range of theorists and philosophers from Socrates to the present.Mitchell first considers how buildings may be described in words and shows how such descriptions may be formalized by the notation of first order predicate calculus. This leads to the idea of a critical language for speaking about the qualities of buildings. Turning to the question of representation by drawings and scale models, Mitchell then develops the notion of design worlds that provide graphic tokens which can be manipulated according to certain grammatical rules. In particular, he shows how domains of graphic compositions possible in a design world may be specified by formal shape grammars. Design worlds and critical languages are connected by showing how such languages may be interpreted in design worlds. Design processes are then viewed as computations in a design world with the objective of satisfying predicates of form and function stated in a critical language.William J. Mitchell is G. Ware and Edythe M. Travelstead Professor of Architecture at Harvard University and a founder of the Computer Aided Design Group in Los Angeles. Among the books he has authored or coauthored are The Poetics of Gardens, The Art of Computer Graphics Programming, and Computer Aided Architectural Design.},

abstract = {There are building systems, called "modularized", in which the component systems (for structure, lighting, etc) can be analyzed and synthesized independently since their performance and design do not interact or affect one another. There are other building systems, called "coupled", in which the component systems do interact and influence one another. The thesis acknowledges that in a building there are both sub-systems that act independently and others that interact. While many design processes have been proposed for dealing with discrete sub-systems, there is no systematic study for building sub-systems that interrelate. This thesis examines a different design approach called integrated. The term "integrated" has a dual utilization in this study. The first use refers to the integration of form and building performance. The second use refers to the integration of interrelated and diverse building performances involving multiple disciplines. The integrated design approach analyzes and evaluates several interrelated design systems involving different disciplines in the early design phase. The goal of the approach is the generation of design alternatives guided simultaneously by two basic objectives: the aspiration for form exploration and the satisfaction of the performances of interrelated systems. After defining a framework for an integrated design approach, which includes inter-disciplinary collaboration, unified design, optimization, simulation, and other formal and digital techniques, the approach will be demonstrated in a case study. The objective of the case study is to demonstrate that the integrated design approach has validity and can be realized, in this case, for the generation of high-rise buildings guided by structural, lighting, zoning codes, and aesthetic criteria.},

abstract = {Urban identity is formed by the entire values and characteristics of a city. Urban transformation is the strategies and activities for maintaining environmental quality and life balance. The concepts of urban identity and urban transformation, which have been quite popular in Turkey recently, are the grounds of this study. The socio-cultural and economic conditions, which have changed as a result of globalization experienced all over the world, make it compulsory to re-shape cities, so urban identity concept has gradually become more important. The aim of this study is to reveal disidentification in Turkey caused by urban transformation implementations, particularly via the example of Isparta. As Isparta is a typical Anatolian city developed after the proclamation of the Republic, it was considered worthy of analysis. At the end of the study, It was observed that Isparta had developed in terms of planning until 1960s. It was concluded that turning points had occurred in urban transformation between the years 1960-1980 and after 1980, these turning points spoiled urban identity, and therefore, the city has developed and globalized without any identity since then .},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2018. This article attempts to reverse a fallacy often met in architectural theories and practices: that of a supposed input which through processes of what one can broadly call translations generates a built output. The input{\textendash}output fallacy produces an architectural black box that treats both architectural thinking and doing as a mere process of projecting, representing and annotating {\textquoteleft}properly{\textquoteright} what will later be executed. On the contrary, a manipulative account of architecture as an active process of ecological engineering will pave the way for not only reversing the fallacy but also towards a particular understanding of architectural practices: architectural technicities and their reticular, affective potentials. Drawing on the theories of Gilbert Simondon, Andr{\'e} Leroi-Gourhan, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, I will examine how architecture can be genealogically approached as a reticular technicity which evolves by a reciprocal concretisation of its technical objects and a generalisation of its active practitioners: no longer the application of transcendental design rules, of symbolic deductions or statistical inductions but rather abductive heuristics of affective techniques; no input nor output but practices of sensorial amplification via material manipulation and vice versa.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, The Author(s). Form-finding processes are an integral part of structural design. Because of their limitations, the classic approaches to finding a form {\textendash} such as hanging models and the soap-film analogy {\textendash} play only a minor role. The various possibilities of digital experimentation in the context of structural optimisation create new options for the designer generating forms, while enabling control over a wide variety of parameters. A complete mapping of the mechanical properties of a structure in a continuum mechanics model is possible but so are simplified modelling strategies which take into account only the most important properties of the structure, such as iteratively approximating to a solution via representations of kinematic states. Form finding is thus an extremely complex process, determined both by the freely selected parameters and by design decisions.},

The first is a tangible computational interface for the design of artifacts such as chairs. Framed within user-driven customization precedents and literature, it suggests ways in which computation can enable new ways of interacting with design knowledge. The second is an architectural installation that uses biometric data from human bodies to dynamically transform an occupant{\textquoteright}s experience of an enclosed space. Documenting the development of a series of prototypes, this experiment outlines an area of design inquiry we term {\textquotedblleft}biometrically-responsive architecture{\textquotedblright}, linking architectural spaces and the human body in new ways. Combining methods from architecture and computation, and emphasizing open-ended bodily interactions over symbolic transactions and goal-driven optimization, these two experiments outline ways in which architectural artifacts and spaces can interact with human designers and occupants in playful ways.},

This paper reviews existing shape grammar implementations in terms of their algorithmic complexity, extends the definition of shape grammars with sets of transformations for rule application, categorizes (parametric and non-parametric) sets of transformations, and analyses these categories in terms of the resulting algorithmic complexity. Specifically, it describes how different sets of transformations admit different numbers of targets (i.e., potential inputs) for rule application. In the non-parametric case, this number is quadratic or cubic, while in the parametric case, it can be non-polynomial, depending on the size of the target shape. The analysis thus yields lower bounds for the algorithmic complexity of shape grammar implementations that hold independently of the employed algorithm or data structure. Based on these bounds, we propose novel matching algorithms for non-parametric and parametric shape grammar implementation and analyze their complexity. The results provide guidance for future, general-purpose shape grammar implementations for design exploration.},

The ultimate goal is to develop a system that could capture some of the characteristics of traditional Muslim cities fabric and use it in contemporary urban planning. Previous papers have proposed the use of three grammars to encode the spatial complexity of the Medina: the urban grammar, the negotiation grammar, and the housing grammar, and addressed the development of the urban grammar. This paper proposes a grammar to describe the formal structure of the houses, the first step in the developments of the remaining two grammars. It describes the set of rules and then illustrates its application in the generation of an existing house. The basic formal structure consists of three concentric rectangular rings with the patio in the middle. The location of the entrance and the staircase are fundamental for the definition of the basic layout.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Kim Williams Books, Turin. For centuries, stereotomy has been the instrument for building arches, staircases and complex vaulted systems using stone as load-bearing material. Its constructive principles, codified in the classical treatises of few historical figures as Alonso de Vandelvira and Philibert de L{\textquoteright}Orme, have found new applications in contemporary architectures, although the carrier is no longer stone, but pre-cast or fabricated components, and the technologies to materialise the whole process have profoundly changed. To demonstrate the great potential that the stereotomic process retains even in a deeply transformed context, the analogies between the stereotomy principles and some of the projects designed by Foster + Partners are outlined. The challenges faced by the builders of the Gothic cathedrals and the great constructions of the Renaissance remain unchanged.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} Cambridge University Press 2018. The goal of this paper is to examine meaning as a component of creativity. We take a demand-based approach for conceptualizing meaning, and propose that it emerges from user needs instead of emerging from already existing creative solutions. Meaning is proposed as a third component of creativity, alongside novelty and usefulness. We test this proposition in a pre-study, and two empirical studies. In the pre-study, designers define creativity and provide examples of solutions that they deem creative. The results of the pre-study yield a 24-item scale for assessing creativity. Then, we conduct two empirical studies, in which we utilize the created scale for measuring creativity, and for examining the components arising thereof. In the first study, we ask creators (design engineering students) to generate ideas for one of two design briefs. Afterwards, creators were asked to rate their own creations, on the 24-item creativity scale. Here, we find a four-factor solution for creative outcomes, consisting of the dimensions novelty, usefulness, cleverness, and meaning. In the second study, we ask independent evaluators (individuals with related and relevant degrees) to assess the creators' work on the creativity scale. Here, we find a three-factor solution for creative outcomes, consisting of the dimensions novelty, usefulness, and meaning. In both studies, meaning emerged as a separate component of creativity. Additionally, in both studies, it accounted for variance that was unaccounted for by novelty and usefulness, thereby increasing the overall explanatory power of creative solutions. These findings strongly speak of meaning as a third component of creativity.},

With the increasing size and complexity of modern buildings, 3D indoor routing is receiving more attention nowadays. Different elements such as route finding, indoor modelling, and route visualisation need to work together to achieve this goal. For this purpose, we propose a framework that makes use of existing data sources and tools that can minimise the time and effort needed for potential 3D indoor routing applications. Our 3D indoor and building models are generated from CAD files and building footprints using CityEngine and its built-in procedural modelling approach. An Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compatible 3D network is created by combining 3D floor lines and transitions such as staircases and elevators. The resulting routes as well as the indoor and fa{\c c}ade models are then visualised through a 3D WebScene generated by CityEngine. Our study demonstrates the usefulness of CityEngine for 3D indoor model generation as well as 3D routing visualisation.},

In solid tessellations or three-dimensional honeycombs, polyhedra fit together to fill space, so that every face of each polyhedron belongs to another polyhedron. Solid and plane tessellations are intrinsically connected, since any section cut through a solid tessellation always produces some kind of plane tessellation. To clarify this relation, we will mention a short list of convex polyhedra that fill space monohedrally and illustrate the convex uniform honeycombs, focusing on those with structural potential to outline spaceframes. With regular plane tessellations as starting point, we hint at the geometrical possibilities in which the Platonic and two Archimedean solids are explorable in topological interlocking, aiming to expand the repertoire of blocks for monohedral topological interlocking assemblies. This has possible applications in architecture, in relation, for example, to space frames.},

This article is motivated by the fact that in Cape Town, South Africa, approximately 7.5 million people live in informal settlements and focuses on potential upgrading strategies for such sites. To this end, we developed a computational method for rapid urban design prototyping. The corresponding planning tool generates urban layouts including street network, blocks, parcels and buildings based on an urban designer{\textquoteright}s specific requirements. It can be used to scale and replicate a developed urban planning concept to fit different sites. To facilitate the layout generation process computationally, we developed a new data structure to represent street networks, land parcellation, and the relationship between the two. We also introduced a nested parcellation strategy to reduce the number of irregular shapes generated due to algorithmic limitations. Network analysis methods are applied to control the distribution of buildings in the communities so that preferred neighborhood relationships can be considered in the design process. Finally, we demonstrate how to compare designs based on various urban analysis measures and discuss the limitations that arise when we apply our method in practice, especially when dealing with more complex urban design scenarios.},

This approach has been used in different ways through history, but the technological advances of the {\textquotedblleft}Third Industrial Revolution{\textquotedblright} offer new perspectives on this topic, along with various design innovations. To face this demand, architects must develop new strategies rooted in performance, connectivity and control, and process them to support and inform design.

The partnership between ISCTE-IUL and Sapienza University of Rome emerged as an opportunity to join an international community to present recent research, teaching or practice related to architecture, technology, computation, mathematics and geometry. In addition, an experimental learning-by-doing design studio was developed, which allowed for testing a digital workflow to create foldable surfaces based on rigid origami geometry. The major objective of these events, which is summarised in this paper, is to contribute to the debate around digitally-driven kinetic architecture.},

The shape grammar method is used for the analysis and synthesis of the hayat house type in a particular context. In the analysis part, the shape grammar method is used to extract basic compositional principles of the hayat house. In the synthesis part, first the evolution of a new hayat house prototype is illustrated. An algorithmic prototype transformation is considered. This transformation is achieved in two ways: by changing the values assigned to the variables that define the component objects of the form, and by replacing the vocabulary elements of the form with new ones. Then, the application of the rule based design method for housing pattern generation is explored. The design of a housing complex is illustrated using this method.},

The idea of generative modeling is to allow the generation of highly complex objects based on a set of formal construction rules. Using these construction rules, a shape is described by a sequence of processing steps, rather than just by the result of all applied operations: Shape design becomes rule design. Due to its very general nature, this approach can be applied to any domain and to any shape representation that provides a set of generating functions. The aim of this report is to give an overview of the concepts and techniques of procedural and generative modeling as well as their applications with a special focus on Archaeology and Architecture.},

It occupies the most important place in the composition of the house. The study is based on a corpus of eight hayat houses designed in the classic Ottoman style in the 18th and 19th centuries in Sarajevo. In this paper, the emphasis is on the generation of new houses. The informal grammar does not explain the designs in detail but rather generates new house designs by transferring some knowledge embedded in original designs. The generation of a new house type within the grammar proceeds in three steps: (1) primitive hayat house generation, (2) subhouse generation, and (3) house variations.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} Cambridge University Press 2017. Product variant design, as one of the key enabling technologies of mass customization, is the transfer of variant information among mating parts from the perspective of informatics. A dimension constraint network (DCN) among mating parts carries on the task of transferring variant information. What are the information transfer characteristics of dimensions in a constraint network is a fundamental issue to plan the product variant design process reasonably. We begin by showing the natural dynamics of the DCN from two aspects: structure and uncertainty. The information efficiency of the DCN was proposed based on its simple path to specify the information transfer capability of the network. Based on this, the information centrality of the dimension was developed by measuring the efficiency loss of the DCN after the removal of a dimension from the network, which describes the information transfer capability of this dimension. Further, the information centrality of a part was derived. Using a spherical valve subassembly, we calculated the information centrality of the dimensions in a constraint network. We determined that the information centrality of dimension is highly correlated to its out-degree. An approach to plan the sequence of the part variant design according to its information centrality was proposed. We calculated the uncertainties of the DCN and its cumulative uncertainties under different sequences of the part variant design. Results indicate that part variant design under the descending information centrality of the parts minimizes the uncertainty of the DCN. This suggests a new method of planning the sequence of part variant design.},

Type 1 is the centrally-positioned Kond-style tiling, a combination of 10-, 12-, and 16-fold rosettes with pentagons and lozenges. Type 2 is a unique curvilinear pattern formed by irregular hexagonal tiles in non-linear hexagonal arrangement. Interpretation of this pattern as a net of intersecting geometric curves is made in the paper and its construction is discussed. Type 3 is represented by colourful non-linear mosaics based on combination of local centers with five and sixfold multiplicity, interpreted as the antithesis of the type 2 mosaic.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} Cambridge University Press 2018. It is well-known that creativity is crucial for sustaining a product against competition. Many factors have been proposed in the literature as indicators of creativity, among which outcome-characteristics-based factors are considered the most reliable; among these, the creativity of an outcome is often indicated by two major factors: novelty and usefulness. Only a few studies address as to how creativity assessment methods and their results can be used during the design process. To systematically address the issue of how to influence creativity of design solutions, the following questions have been framed. (1) Which factors should be used as indicators of creativity consistently across different phases of the engineering design process? (2) How can creativity be assessed in terms of these factors during the engineering design process? In this work, we consider novelty and usefulness as the necessary factors for creativity. It is found, however, that it is not possible to directly assess the usefulness of outcomes during the design process. Therefore, requirement satisfaction is used as a proxy for usefulness. We propose a creativity assessment method that uses novelty and requirement satisfaction as indicators for creativity; the method can be used for assessing not only complete products but also ideas or concepts, as they evolve through the phases of the design process. The application of the method in design is explained using a detailed example from a case study.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Cambridge University Press. Shape grammars come in a variety of forms. Algebras of shapes have been defined for spatial elements of different kinds, as well as for shapes augmented with varying attributes, allowing for grammar forms to be expressed in terms of a direct product of basic algebras. This algebraic approach is extended here to the algebraic derivation of combinations of basic shape algebras with attribute algebras. This algebraic abstraction at the same time serves as a procedural abstraction, giving insights into the modular implementation of a general shape grammar interpreter for different grammar forms. In addition, we consider practical limitations on algebraic compositions of basic shape algebras with attribute algebras and identify a complication with respect to solving the matching problem for parallel and compound shape grammars, suggesting a way to address this complication.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Cambridge University Press. I present an implementation of shape grammars that is aimed at supporting designers. It has two parts: a grammar editor and a stand-alone interpreter. The editor is the modeling application Rhinoceros3d using Python scripts. The interpreter is general, is three-dimensional, and supports subshape detection. A grammar is a Rhinoceros3d model; thus users can manipulate all its parts directly and immediately. That is, they can modify any shape without selecting or invoking an editor, and they can lay out the parts of the grammar in any way they find meaningful. Using this approach, which I call a whole-grammar approach, users are shielded from most subdomain tasks, like typing text files or specifying transformations. Informal observations suggest that users of this implementation can work effectively.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Copyright Cambridge University Press 2018. This paper shows the way Leon Battista Alberti treatise De Re Aedificatoria column systematization shape grammar was built, and how the longitudinal elevation of the nave of the Sant'Andrea church was designed, evidencing some steps involved in the grammar construction process, its derivation, and the partial outputs gained from the grammar evaluation. The goal of this grammar is to infer Alberti's treatise rules through a computational approach evidencing its algorithmic nature, illustrating it, and understanding the De Re Aedificatoria rules that may be applied in the generation of some parts of buildings such as the Sant'Andrea church, showing a complementary method to archaeological, bibliographical, historical ones, among others, that have been used to understand the built environment. The rules provided by the grammar may be applied to an initial insertion point to produce a complete column and to a pre-existing plan or section element of a building generating its facade. It was proved, evaluating the grammar with a simple linear regression method, to what extent the treatise influenced the design of the facade in the study.},
