<!-- This is the abstract -->

The loss of identity of traditional tissues in cities is a crucial problem. In addition, constructing new buildings in the regions where the traditional tissues of the cities are located has always been a subject of discussions and research. The study aims to code CGA grammar by utilizing the procedural modeling technique and to produce parametric design templates for new designs to be made in the Ortahisar neighborhood, where combines the characteristic examples of the traditional tissue of the city of Trabzon and constitutes the core of the city.

In order to encode the CGA grammar, an ontology study on traditional Ortahisar residences is carried out and the relevant rules are visualized with the shape grammar. In addition to these rules, numerical data obtained from surveys are recorded in the tables. It has been found that the features of the building base area, number and heights of floors, façade character, façade projections, façade elements and  form and slope of roofs are the determinants of the typological design language. Considering these features, the semantic and formal information of the design elements and their combinations are defined parametrically with the CGA grammar, which is a set grammar. The system introduced with the created CGA grammar has been prepared to assist in computerized and conventional design processes and has made it possible for the designer to make interactive changes on template models.
