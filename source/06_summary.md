<!-- This is the abstract -->

The loss of identity of traditional tissues in cities is a crucial problem. In addition, constructing new buildings in the regions where the traditional tissues of the cities are located has always been a subject of discussions and research. The study aims to code CGA grammar by utilizing the procedural modeling technique and to produce parametric design templates for new designs to be made in the Ortahisar neighborhood, where combines the characteristic examples of the traditional tissue of the city of Trabzon and constitutes the core of the city.

While collecting data on traditional Ortahisar residences, the most important sources are the surveys of the residences in the archives of Trabzon Metropolitan Municipality and the Directorate of Monuments. By scrutinizing and measuring these surveys with traditional methods, the necessary numerical values ​​about the structures are recorded in the tables. The typological design language of traditional houses is analyzed using the shape grammar, and the grammar rules were defined.

It has been found that the features of the building base area, number and heights of floors, façade character, façade projections, façade elements and  form and slope of roofs are the determinants of the typological design language. Considering these features, the syntactic and formal information of the design elements and their combinations are defined parametrically with the CGA grammar, which is a set grammar. The system introduced with the created CGA grammar has been prepared to assist in a conventional design process and has made it possible for the designer to make interactive changes on template models.
