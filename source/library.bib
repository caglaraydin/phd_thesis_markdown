abstract = {This paper examines Parametric Design (PD) in contemporary architectural practice. It considers three case studies: The Future of Us pavilion, the Louvre Abu Dhabi and the Morpheus Hotel. The case studies illustrate how, compared to non-parametrically and older parametrically designed projects, PD is employed to generate, document and fabricate designs with a greater level of detail and differentiation, often at the level of individual building components. We argue that such differentiation cannot be achieved with conventional Building Information Modelling and without customizing existing software. We compare the case studies' PD approaches (objected-oriented programming, functional programming, visual programming and distributed visual programming) and decomposition, algorithms and data structures as crucial factors for the practical viability of complex parametric models and as key aspects of PD thinking.},

This essay will focus mainly on the fabrication methods in terms of why and the pedagogical research initiatives and reactions that went into the design of Swell. The project was conceived through a summer studio which was formed to investigate tools and methods available at the Texas A{\&}M Architecture Ranch and to further the local pedagogical direction toward fabrication in architectural design at Texas A{\&}M University as a whole. That is to say, there was no specific agenda toward parametrics, form, research, technology, or the like. At the same time, as the research continued, certain decisions were cast in terms of technology, sensibility, site, etc. informed by research, iterative processes, or parametric evaluation that ultimately formed the project as it exists today.},

abstract = {It is desirable to design buildings with natural daylight and views to the outside, which can maximize passive solar heating, minimize electric lighting use and contribute to feelings of wellbeing and awareness. Unfortunately, the presence of daylight is not always a positive one. Excessive brightness, strong contrast or intense reflections from daylight can cause visual discomfort or the inability to perform tasks. Typically, the total amount of luminous flux incident upon a surface per unit area - illuminance - present is used to predict visual discomfort due to questions about the benefit and validity of luminance-based analysis measures that are more related to the way the human visual system perceives light. This thesis aims to advance the understanding and usefulness of visual comfort prediction to the point that it can become commonly used in architectural design processes. One method through which this is achieved is by testing the ability of visual comfort analysis to resolve subjective occupant comfort. It was found that of existing discomfort glare metrics, daylight glare probability (DGP) was the most likely to perform well in a variety of daylight conditions and space types. Furthermore, a long-term simulation and survey study found that between 53.7{\%} and 70.1{\%} of an occupant's visual satisfaction could be resolved by analyzing DGP, the presence of direct sunlight and predicted monitor contrast ratio. This choice of metrics was reinforced by a separate laboratory study, which found that 74.4{\%} of subjective comfort could be resolved and identified new subjective luminance thresholds that identify likely discomfort. A new adaptive visual comfort model, the 'adaptive zone,' is proposed in this thesis to deal with spatiality and view in visual discomfort analysis. Finally, ways of applying these verified and new measures in design processes are tackled in this work by producing new temporal maps, spatial discomfort analysis, and plan-based mappings of visual satisfaction.},

abstract = {We introduce a real-time interactive visual editing paradigm for shape grammars, allowing the creation of rulebases from scratch without text file editing. In previous work, shape-grammar based procedural techniques were successfully applied to the creation of architectural models. However, those methods are text based, and may therefore be difficult to use for artists with little computer science background. Therefore the goal was to enable a visual workflow combining the power of shape grammars with traditional modeling techniques. We extend previous shape grammar approaches by providing direct and persistent local control over the generated instances, avoiding the combinatorial explosion of grammar rules for modifications that should not affect all instances. The resulting visual editor is flexible: All elements of a complex state-of-the-art grammar can be created and modified visually.},

abstract = {As the capability to render complex, realistic scenes in real time increases, many applications of computer graphics are hitting the problem of manual model creation. In virtual reality, researchers have found that creating and updating static models is a difficult and time-consuming task Brooks 1999. New games require massive amounts of content. Creating such content is such an expensive process that it may drive smaller companies out of business Wright 2005. Content creators cannot keep up with the increasing demand for many high-quality models; algorithms will have to be called upon to assist. Procedural methods, algorithms that specify some characteristic of a scene and generate a model Ebert et al. 2002, are a possible solution to the content creation problem. With such methods, the algorithm, not an artist, determines the detailed attributes of the sceneattributes ranging from color to motion to objects. Recently, procedural methods have been applied to generating manmade artifacts including cities. Parish and M{\"{u}}ller used L-systems to generate a city street map and geometry and textures for buildings within the city Parish and M{\"{u}}ller 2001. Focusing on city modeling, Greuter et al. describe a procedure to generate buildings based on vertical extrusion of randomly generated polygons Greuter et al. 2003. Lechner et al. use an agent-based simulation to generate a city map but do not attempt buildings Lechner et al. 2003. Though some of the buildings appear believable, each of these research efforts focused on the realistic creation of the city rather than the buildings themselves. Wonka et al. focus more on the appearance of the buildings using a split grammar to control the external appearance so that it conforms to architectural rules Wonka et al. 2003.},

abstract = {Computer games often take place in extensive virtual worlds, attractive for roaming and exploring. Unfortunately, current virtual cities can strongly hinder this kind of gameplay, since the buildings they feature typically have replicated interiors, or no interiors at all. Procedural content generation is becoming more established, with many techniques for automatically creating specific building elements. However, the integration of these techniques to form complete buildings is still largely unexplored, limiting their application to open game worlds. We propose a novel approach that integrates existing procedural techniques to generate such buildings. With minimal extensions, individual techniques can be coordinated to create buildings with consistently interrelated exteriors and interiors, as in the real world. Our solution offers a framework where various procedural techniques communicate with a moderator, which is responsible for negotiating the placement of building elements, making use of a library of semantic classes and constraints. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by presenting several examples featuring the integration of a fa{\&}{\#}x00E7;ade shape grammar, two different floor plan layout generation techniques, and furniture placement techniques. We conclude that this approach allows one to preserve the individual qualities of existing procedural techniques, while assisting the consistency maintenance of the generated buildings.},

abstract = {There are building systems, called "modularized", in which the component systems (for structure, lighting, etc) can be analyzed and synthesized independently since their performance and design do not interact or affect one another. There are other building systems, called "coupled", in which the component systems do interact and influence one another. The thesis acknowledges that in a building there are both sub-systems that act independently and others that interact. While many design processes have been proposed for dealing with discrete sub-systems, there is no systematic study for building sub-systems that interrelate. This thesis examines a different design approach called integrated. The term "integrated" has a dual utilization in this study. The first use refers to the integration of form and building performance. The second use refers to the integration of interrelated and diverse building performances involving multiple disciplines. The integrated design approach analyzes and evaluates several interrelated design systems involving different disciplines in the early design phase. The goal of the approach is the generation of design alternatives guided simultaneously by two basic objectives: the aspiration for form exploration and the satisfaction of the performances of interrelated systems. After defining a framework for an integrated design approach, which includes inter-disciplinary collaboration, unified design, optimization, simulation, and other formal and digital techniques, the approach will be demonstrated in a case study. The objective of the case study is to demonstrate that the integrated design approach has validity and can be realized, in this case, for the generation of high-rise buildings guided by structural, lighting, zoning codes, and aesthetic criteria.},

abstract = {This paper examines 3D modelling of architectural elements with the help of parametric components. Such components may be useful within the framework of projects dealing with virtual 3D reconstruction of heritage monuments. Architectural components of the built heritage often have complex geometry. We studied the various geometrical shapes of a given architectural element, representative of a specific period and place. This study allowed us to identify the parameters and to implement parametric objects (in Maya Environment [1]). We also developed a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to answer the user's needs while generating the 3D model representing the architectural element. Within this GUI, the user is able to make adjustments with the help of laser point clouds from laserscanning, 2D plans or photographs. We exemplify our method with a case study dealing with openings and lintels. The corpus under study consists of elements of the built heritage of Montreal (Canada) and Nancy (France).},

abstract = {This study targets to address the problem of 'new building in a traditional setting', utilizing computational design tools. The intention is to provide a methodology for analysis of architectural features of a traditional tissue and moreover propose computational design strategies utilizing algorithms for processing analytical data serving new building design. In the introduction part, this goal is exposed as well as a critic discussion based on a conservationist perspective for contemporary examples of computational design. Contemporary digital tools and methods employed in the field of architecture are discussed with a focus on algorithmic approaches, followed by a brief history for utilization of computational tools and digital design philosophy in the following chapter. Moreover organic architecture is discussed as a complex entity composed of integral elements and their relations, as well as the designer‟s new position, confronted with such complex systems and equipped with computational tools. In parallel, digital-organics is introduced as a term referring for the methodology proposed in this thesis, namely an approach for revealing the tissue to its fragments, uncovering parameters working in its composition. Third chapter presents general characteristics and architectural history of Kalkan Historical Town Centre, as the case of this dissertation, and the following two chapters demonstrate the analysis methods exercised on Kalkan. Three overlapping levels of analysis have been designed; basic architectural analysis, comparisons and relations between fragments, and detailed analysis on a set of selected buildings, respectively. Finally, Chapter 6 exposes not only the discussion of the results, but also the constitution and improvement of the rule sets, the core expressions to be converted to algorithms. These rule sets intend to reveal the design logic of the organic tissue in Kalkan, in the form of variables and constraints to work for new building design as a decision support},

With the complexity of information generated in process-based digital practices, we need to effectively manage and exchange the information. Feedback loops are integral to this process/product, and thus require extensive management of complex versions of visual and data related information. Quite a lot of scholarly attention has been focused upon highlighting innovative projects using digital fabrication and serial customization. However, there is a scarcity of scholarly work about innovations in visualizing and representing the design data integral in this feedback loop. This paper will examine innovative representational devices such as the matrix, sectioning, layering, bracketing, nesting, and other new forms of organizing, visualizing, analyzing, and simulating complex data, intent upon communicating multiple levels of operations during the design and fabrication process. With a rigorous taxonomy of operative and analytic devices for process-based digital design development, we can begin to outline a trajectory for future evolutions in practice. This writing is an attempt to make a few steps in this direction, and demonstrate some of these new representational ideas in practice.},

abstract = {Performance-driven architectural design emphasizes on integrated and comprehensive optimization of various quantifiable performances of buildings. As the leading profession of a project team, architects play a vital role in guiding and conducting the performance-driven design. Methodology and techniques start emerging both in literature and practice. However, architects often find them difficult to use for various reasons. Therefore, developing an effective technique to conduct performance-driven design and optimization from the perspective of architects is necessary. This paper starts from discussing the concept of performance-driven architectural design. Existing methodology and techniques are reviewed. The focus is on selecting a basic platform suitable for architects, upon which the technique can be developed. Rhinoceros, an architectural modeling program, is used, along with its graphical algorithm editor Grasshopper, to establish such technique by incorporating three performance simulation programs, namely Ecotect, Radiance, and EnergyPlus. Design cases are presented to demonstrate the technique and its effectiveness. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A novel approach to generate virtual building interiors in real-time is presented. The interiors are generated in a top-down fashion using architectural guidelines. Although a building interior in its entirety may be quite large, only the portions that are needed immediately are generated. This lazy generation scheme allows the use of only a fraction of the memory that a model of the entire interior would otherwise require. Our method provides real-time frame rates, making it attractive for realtime interactive applications.Memory is controlled by deleting regions of the interior that are no longer needed. That said, any changes made in these regions will not be lost. We provide a simple and efficient method to allow changes made to the interior to persist past the life time of the regions that contain them. This allows a dynamic, consistent environment and increases control over the content by allowing developers to make changes.

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {Abstract Computational design has recently come to recast the conventional urban design strategies. The complexity of urban planning exceeds the potential owned by manual design techniques to produce an array of distinguishable solutions while competent to deal with varying demands during urban design process. This paper explores the means to create a flexible urban design tool that could afford to conceive complex solutions with cooperative computational design techniques. The computational process defined to accomplish a flexible tool is divided into two parts; shape grammars and evolutionary algorithms. The flexibility to satisfy constantly changing demands is constituted by parametric shape grammars that consist of variables. Genetic algorithms and genetic programming are compared and suggested to meet the optimisation problem of the flexibility controlled by parametric variables which are described by shape grammars. Since these techniques imitate evolutionary theories, primitive urban patterns and the philosophies in the background are discussed to elucidate the concept of urban. In so doing, it is aimed to adhere to a theoretically rich foundation on which a robust design tool could be built. With regards to a pragmatic explanation, urban neoliberalism is addressed as it paves the way for large-scale developments. Urban projects such as urban renewals and neighbourhood extensions are prevalent implementations of Neoliberal urbanism in fast-growing countries where the accelerated urban design practices cause the distortion of existing urban texture. The parametric urban design tool proposed in this paper pays special attention to the coexistence of the new and old in harmony with each other. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to present a guidance for a computational solution within this complexity.},

Starting from an input image, the facade is hierarchically segmented and labeled with a collection of manual and automatic tools. The user can then model constraints that should be maintained in any variation of the input facade design. Subsequently, facade variations are generated for different facade sizes, where multiple variations can be produced for a certain size. Computing such new facade variations has many unique challenges, and we propose a new algorithm based on interleaving heuristic search and quadratic programming. In contrast to most previous work, we focus on the generation of new design variations and not on the automatic analysis of the input's structure. Adding a modeling step with the user in the loop ensures that our results routinely are of high quality.},

abstract = {2012b The vision to engage non-architects in the design of their habitat through the mediation of computer aids, dates back to the early computational era (1960s-1970s) and is currently being recast under cyber-cultural and technological influences. The computational tools enabling this architectural do-it-yourself-ism have been traditionally conceptualized as mediating “infrastructures:” neutral and non-defining control systems, which ensure the validity of the designs produced by the non- expert users without distorting their personal hypotheses. Through a critical comparative analysis of two basal computational systems for design “democratization,” as discussed in Yona Friedman's and Nicholas Negroponte's early 1970s writings, this thesis illustrates that the “infrastructure” metaphor was engendered and still resides in a positivist paradigm of design, allowing for little freedom or intuition on behalf of the user. Rather than denouncing the internal contradictions of the “structure for freedom” model, this thesis inquires into the computational structures of Friedman's and Negroponte's proto-computational proposals in order to identify and critique the assumptions which underpin their optimism about the non-paternalistic character of their control systems. By exposing the discursive role of the internal workings of the two systems in their authors' arguments, along with their cultural and historical biases, this research aims to problematize inherited approaches to computational tools for user empowerment in design which persist until the present, and to hint to new programmatic agendas},

abstract = {This thesis proposes a conceptual framework for applications of self-organizing logics in generative design systems. The methods introduced in this thesis are in an abstract and conceptual form that explores one possible future direction of computational design strategy. In order to explain the potential of this problem-solving direction, general aspects of what our contemporary practice in architecture and urban design is facing will be discussed in response to the increasing complexity in our culture. However, the main focus of this thesis is not on providing immediate solution methods to resolve any specific professional problems in contemporary architecture. Rather, the thesis investigates the emergent characteristics of this method that can potentially evolve new design solutions over time, and shows how tools employing the method can be used for design collaboration with humans, rather than simply as passive evaluation and analysis tools. The thesis foresees important potential for this new design direction inspired by self-organizing computation (SOC) and speculates regarding its potential areas of application in architecture and urban design. In recent years, many scientists have started to gain the advantages of self-organizing systems in nature through their computational models in areas such as telecommunication networks and robotics. Main advantages of such systems are robustness, flexibility, adaptability, concurrency, and distributedness. One of the unique characteristics of SOC is its non-reliance on any external knowledge. As with many conventional computational methods in architecture, imposing existing design patterns or transformation sequences is beneficial when one wants to efficiently derive what appear to be the subjects of our recognitions. However, reliance on a pre-existing template might preclude the possibility of discovering what original inputs naturally turn into. SOC is a computational approach that brings out the strengths of the dynamic mechanisms of self-organizing systems: structures appear at the global level of a system from interactions among its lower-level components. In order to computationally implement the mechanisms, the system's constituent units (subunits) and the rules that define their interactions (behaviors) need to be described. The system expects emergence of global-scale spatial structures from the locally defined interactions of its own components.},

@phdthesis{Herr2008,
abstract = {Cellular automata (CA) are systems of cells capable of generating intricate patterns based on rules relating to local cell neighbourhoods. In the field of architectural design, CA have been adopted as one of a variety of generative design approaches, which aim to use computers to support design beyond imitating conventional drawing tools. Previous applications to architectural design have employed CA mainly to generate representations of physical building form. Furthermore, such applications have typically adopted CA models from other fields of study without considering possible modifications to specifically support architectural design. This study explores how CA can be adapted to the architectural design context to support architectural design, focusing on the early, conceptual stages of the design process. Based on a literature review and initial proposition, an extended CA model was proposed to address the modelling of architectural form as well as the integration of CA into the conceptual design process. To accommodate the exploratory nature of this study as well as the characteristically difficult to predict nature of design results, action research with a qualitative focus was adopted as the method of inquiry. The initially proposed extended CA model was developed through five research cycles, each of which consisted of the development of CA-based software implementations that were applied by architecture students in design studio and workshop settings. Field notes, interviews, design critiques as well as questionnaires and software interaction tracking were evaluated to inform the development of subsequent implementations. The first three implementations were based on the initially proposed extended CA model, and focused on the generation of building form. For this purpose, CA with extended modelling capacities were introduced, such as non-uniform grids and cell neighbourhoods. These applications however yielded only limited success, as students tended to transcend the limits of given software by misappropriating it for their individual purposes. In response to these results, the fourth and in particular the fifth implementation integrated CA with diagrammatic representations to encourage re-interpretation during the conceptual design stages. These “automated diagrams” consisted of semi-automated diagrammatic representations that employed CA to respond to manipulations according to user-defined rules. Results from the five implementations suggest that generic CA-based design support focusing on the generation of form does not provide sufficient opportunities for concept development. Diagrammatic representations integrated with CA-based functions could however enrich the early stages of students' architectural design processes by encouraging individual interpretations of CA-generated outcomes. Student comments further suggested that the configuration and application of rules should be developed to enable more intuitive and less precise ways to configure and apply rules. This study contributes an extended CA model adapted for architectural design purposes. Outcomes of this study suggest that CA-based architectural design process support is not limited to the generation of intricate patterns representing physical building form. CA may also support conceptual design processes by integrating rule-based element relationships with diagrammatic visual representations. Such “automated diagrams” enable designers to explore intangible aspects of design problems that are related to personal design intentions and interpretations.},

A key outcome is the concept of ‘spatial configuration' — meaning relations which take account of other relations in a complex. New techniques have been developed and applied to a wide range of architectural and urban problems. The aim of this book is to assemble some of this work and show how it leads the way to a new type of theory of architecture: an ‘analytic' theory in which understanding and design advance together. The success of configurational ideas in bringing to light the spatial logic of buildings and cities suggests that it might be possible to extend these ideas to other areas of the human sciences where problems of configuration and pattern are critical.},

To implement the urban modeling system, an improved production based grammar system is used to control the process of urban generation in detail, and this improved grammar system can avoid the disadvantage (such as hard to control etc.) of the grammar system and to ensure the coherent architecture styles of ancient vernacular houses. Because of the advantages (accurate modeling and rapid generating) of this semantic project system, it can be applied to the preserving of the digital heritage in southeast China vernacular architecture.},

abstract = {In the past decade a certain number of studies have suggested that shape grammars and their capability for producing alternative solutions represent an adequate tool for overcoming complexities regarding urban design. In this paper we present a critical analysis of various approaches to shape grammar application in urban design. The aim of this research is to provide an insight into the current state-of-the-art developments and give a critical evaluation on the basis of the criteria of interactivity and flexibility in the approach. We identify two main concepts of grammar application in urban design and outline their characteristics. We conclude that a generic or context-independent approach to shape grammars can provide high levels of flexibility and interaction with the user. This, coupled with their ability to encode different layers of information, facilitates their use for design exploration and problem solving in an urban context.},

Here, we consider making through the lens of a unique computational theory of design: shape grammars. We propose a computational theory of making based on the improvisational, perception and action approach of shape grammars and the shape algebras that support them. We modify algebras for the materials (basic elements) of shapes to define algebras for the materials of objects, or things. Then we adapt shape grammars for computing shapes to making grammars for computing things. We give examples of making grammars and their algebras. We conclude by reframing designing and making in light of our computational theory of making.},

abstract = {The rapid development of computer graphics and imaging provides the modern archeologist with several tools to realistically model and visualize archeological sites in 3D. This, however, creates a tension between veridical and realistic modeling. Visually compelling models may lead people to falsely believe that there exists very precise knowledge about the past appearance of a site. In order to make the underlying uncertainty visible, it has been proposed to encode this uncertainty with different levels of transparency in the rendering, or of decoloration of the textures. We argue that procedural modeling technology based on shape grammars provides an interesting alternative to such measures, as they tend to spoil the experience for the observer. Both its efficiency and compactness make procedural modeling a tool to produce multiple models, which together sample the space of possibilities. Variations between the different models express levels of uncertainty implicitly, while letting each individual model keeping its realistic appearance. The underlying, structural description makes the uncertainty explicit. Additionally, procedural modeling also yields the flexibility to incorporate changes as knowledge of an archeological site gets refined. Annotations explaining modeling decisions can be included. We demonstrate our procedural modeling implementation with several recent examples.},

In this studio, topics of parametric design, parametric modelling and relationality was questioned through design process. In 2006-2007 spring semester in the Graduate Studio II course of Computational Design Program at Yildiz Technical University, parametric modelling software, GenerativeComponents, was introduced to question the pros and cons of parametric design in architecture. In this software there are no ready-made geometric primitives or shapes. Point is the only ready-made drawing element to use. A geometric shape is constructed by associating elements with each other. Each geometric association can be done through a number of commands with different parameters. The end-product is a parameter-based entity. Parameters can be changed easily, which in turn changes the whole geometric shape. In this design research studio held by 10 students, the topics of parametric design and associative thinking are questioned to explore their effect on the practices of architectural design and education.},

The goal of analyzing these models is to integrate their structural and geometrical characteristics with the aim of overcoming high lateral loading conditions in towers, as well as elaborating on the existence of multi-functionality and integration throughout the subsystems of the tower. A series of computational models which abstract the biological properties and articulate them with a generative approach through the use of agent-based systems are implemented according to designated evaluation criteria. },

abstract = {Generation of home plans based on several attributes like constraints and preferences is an interesting research area. Most related research works on floor plan generation do not always adhere to the necessary constraints such as reachability, connectivity and different shaping. This paper presents a novel and flexible technique for generating floor plans subject to minimum geometrical requirements, architectural and legal attributes by showing generated floor plans for different shaped designs with satisfying set of attributes. Since there are number of possible combinations to generate a floor plan, it is really a challenging task to figure out the optimum solution for a particular scenario. Rather than evaluating the floor plan after applying a set of attributes, system checks whether the floor plan satisfies the requirements, while generating the floor plan inside a single rule in knowledgebase. The proposed model would result in minimizing the number of attributes associated with the most important features in architectural home designing, significant reduction in designing costs and release of human labor. The main feature of the proposed system is its representation power since it is not limited to representing just rectangular shaped floor plans. In totality, this tends to increase customer satisfaction as a final goal of the system. Furthermore the method is efficient and easy to implement and integrate into the larger context of modeling of home plans.},

The guidelines guarantee that the resulting subdivisions are functionally and geometrically plausible for subsequent building modeling and construction. Our results include visual and statistical comparisons that demonstrate how the parcel configurations created by our method can closely resemble those found in real-world cities of a large variety of styles. By directly addressing the block subdivision problem, we intend to increase the editability and realism of the urban modeling pipeline and to become a standard in parcel generation for future urban modeling methods.},

abstract = {This paper introduces the use of parametric design tools in the domain of large-scale urban planning. The 253-hectare site in Moscow, Russia, was selected as the study case of the methodology. Through the exploration of a differentiated urban order functioning within a framework of overall coherence the site is interpreted as an informational data field. In the particular example, a data field represents a set of points distributed on the site. A manipulative set of input parameters is derived from the contextual forces around the site – such as 1950's socialist housing, the new urban Moscow City and the Moscow river - while output variables incorporate a distance value for each important point on the site to those of the surrounding elements. Using script-based techniques, values are translated into the urban and formal responses of building typology, height, connectivity and directionality. These data-holding elements then cumulatively outline the pattern and grain of the site. The use of multiple transformative building typologies creates an urban tapestry bringing about diversification within the urban field, whereas the negotiation and continual shift between singular and plural building masses becomes the premise of the architectural condition. Hence, the design process focuses on the formal resolution of the multiple juxtaposed patterns that emerge from the site.

@book{Brown1997,
abstract = {Since The social logic of space was published in 1984, Bill Hillier and his colleagues at University College London have been conducting research on how space features in the form and functioning of buildings and cities. A key outcome is the concept of ‘spatial configuration' — meaning relations which take account of other relations in a complex. New techniques have been developed and applied to a wide range of architectural and urban problems. The aim of this book is to assemble some of this work and show how it leads the way to a new type of theory of architecture: an ‘analytic' theory in which understanding and design advance together. The success of configurational ideas in bringing to light the spatial logic of buildings and cities suggests that it might be possible to extend these ideas to other areas of the human sciences where problems of configuration and pattern are critical.},

The parametric software was extended where necessary to integrate with structural analysis and to automate fabrication. By reducing the overhead associated with design iterations, this approach allowed detailed exploration of options and early identification and resolution of potential problems. In this paper, the authors add to the body of scientific knowledge by describing in detail the methods which led to the construction of the Aviva Stadium. This paper is written in light of the completed building and provides information on the generation and control of the envelope geometry, development and analysis of structure and documentation for construction. Whilst these components have been discussed independently previously [1-4], here these aspects are drawn together for the first time and are presented alongside thoughts on the manufacturing and construction processes from the project architect.},

The geometric complexity of these early physical models led to the involvement of the Specialist Modelling Group and the use of the computer to digitally sketch 3D CaD models. after many studies, the complex form of the canopies was rationalised using torus geometry. a computer program was written to generate the canopy glazing and structure. This parametric system was developed to be a design tool, and was developed by an architectural designer working with the team. Through its use the team were able to explore more design options, and alter the design farther along in the design process; however, this generative tool was created largely as a CaD efficiency tool. another series of computer programs were written to generate and populate a shading system based on environmental analysis. unlike the computer program that generated the structure and glazing, this program was not developed to make the generation of complex geometric structures more efficient, but developed to explore computational approaches that would have been impossible without the computer. Most of the canopys design was communicated to fabricator through a geometry method statement, a method that has been proven to be effective in the past. The project completed in June 2008.},

abstract = {In Contagious Architecture, Luciana Parisi offers a philosophicalinquiry into the status of the algorithm in architectural and interaction design. Her thesis is thatalgorithmic computation is not simply an abstract mathematical tool but constitutes a mode ofthought in its own right, in that its operation extends into forms of abstraction that lie beyonddirect human cognition and control. These include modes of infinity, contingency, and indeterminacy,as well as incomputable quantities underlying the iterative process of algorithmic processing.The main philosophical source for the project is Alfred North Whitehead, whoseprocess philosophy is specifically designed to provide a vocabulary for "modes of thought"exhibiting various degrees of autonomy from human agency even as they are mobilized by it. Becausealgorithmic processing lies at the heart of the design practices now reshaping our world -- from thephysical spaces of our built environment to the networked spaces of digital culture -- the nature ofalgorithmic thought is a topic of pressing importance that reraises questions of control and,ultimately, power. Contagious Architecture revisits cybernetic theories ofcontrol and information theory's notion of the incomputable in light of this rethinking of the roleof algorithmic thought. Informed by recent debates in political and cultural theory around thechanging landscape of power, it links the nature of abstraction to a new theory of power adequate tothe complexities of the digital world.},

@phdthesis{Oxman2010,
abstract = {The institutionalized separation between form, structure and material, deeply embedded in modernist design theory, paralleled by a methodological partitioning between modeling, analysis and fabrication, resulted in geometric-driven form generation. Such prioritization of form over material was carried into the development and design logic of CAD. Today, under the imperatives and growing recognition of the failures and environmental liabilities of this approach, modern design culture is experiencing a shift to material aware design. Inspired by Nature's strategies where form generation is driven by maximal performance with minimal resources through local material property variation, the research reviews, proposes and develops models and processes for a material-based approach in computationally enabled form-generation. Material-based Design Computation is developed and proposed as a set of computational strategies supporting the integration of form, material and structure by incorporating physical form-finding strategies with digital analysis and fabrication. In this approach, material precedes shape, and it is the structuring of material properties as a function of structural and environmental performance that generates design form. The thesis proposes a unique approach to computationally-enabled form-finding procedures, and experimentally investigates how such processes contribute to novel ways of creating, distributing and depositing material forms. Variable Property Design is investigated as a theoretical and technical framework by which to model, analyze and fabricate objects with graduated properties designed to correspond to multiple and continuously varied functional constraints. The following methods were developed as the enabling mechanisms of Material Computation: Tiling Behavior {\&} Digital Anisotropy, Finite Element Synthesis, and Material Pixels. In order to implement this approach as a fabrication process, a novel fabrication technology, termed Variable Property Rapid Prototyping has been developed, designed and patented. Among the potential contributions is the achievement of a high degree of customization through material heterogeneity as compared to conventional design of components and assemblies. Experimental designs employing suggested theoretical and technical frameworks, methods and techniques are presented, discussed and demonstrated. They support product customization, rapid augmentation and variable property fabrication. Developed as approximations of natural formation processes, these design experiments demonstrate the contribution and the potential future of a new design and research field.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {In a quest for promoting sustainable modes of mobility, we have revisited how feasible and suitable is it for people to walk or cycle to their destinations in a neighbourhood. We propose a few accessibility measures based on an 'Easiest Path' algorithm that provides also actual temporal distance between locations. This algorithm finds paths that are as short, flat and straightforward as possible. Considering several 'points of interest', the methods can answer such questions as "do I have a 5 minutes 'easy' walking/cycling access to all/any of these points?" or, "which is the preferred point of interest with 'easy' walking cycling access?" We redefine catchment zones using Fuzzy logics and allow for mapping 'closeness' considering preferences such as 'how far' people are willing to go on foot/bike for reaching a particular destination. The accessibility measures are implemented in the toolkit CONFIGURBANIST to provide real-time analysis of urban networks for design and planning.},

abstract = {The following parametric shape grammar generates the compositional forms and specifies the function zones of Frank Lloyd Wright's prairie-style houses. The establishment of a fireplace is the key to the definition of the prairie-style house. Around the fireplace, functionally distinguished Froebelean-type blocks are recursively added and interpenetrated to form the basic compositions from which elaborated prairie-style houses are derived. The grammar is based on a corpus of eleven houses from the Winslow house, the evolutionary precursor of the style, to the Robie house, considered by many as the culmination of the style. Much has been written about the prairie-style houses--their balance, their debt to Beaux Arts and Japanese design traditions, and the organic qualities. However, such descriptions do not explicitly inform us as to how prairie-style houses are constructed, and consequently provide little help in designing new members of this style. The power of a grammar, such as the one given here, is that it establishes a recursive structure from which new designs can be constructed. Three new prairie houses generated by the grammar as well as a step-by-step generation of one of these designs are shown.},

abstract = {In historic design conventions geometry has traditionally promoted descriptive manifestations of form. Beyond the realm of geometry, the concept of performance which may inform such manifestations also carries important potential for design generation. This work explores the relation between geometry and performance from a computational-geometry perspective. It does so by revisiting certain analytical tools offered in most of todays 3-D modelers which support the evaluation of any generated surface geometry specifically curvature and draft angle analysis. It is demonstrated that these tools can be reconstructed with added functionality assigning 3-D geometrical features informed by structural and environmental performance respectively. In the examples illustrated surface thickness (as a function of structural performance) is assigned to curvature values, and transparency (as a function of light performance) is assigned to light analysis values. In a broader scope this work promotes a methodology of performance-informed form generation by means of computational geometry.Vector and tensor math was exploited to reconstruct existing analytical tools adapted to function as design generators.},

@book{Frazer1995,
abstract = {Electronic version of An Evolutionary Architecture An Evolutionary Architecture was published in January 1995 to coincide with an exhibition of the same name at the Architectural Association. It concentrates on the work of Diploma Unit 11 run by John and Julia Frazer (with Pete Silver and Guy Westbrook) between 1989 and 1996, but includes formative work by the author dating back to his diploma prize-winning project at the AA in 1969 and related research work at Cambridge University. The book investigates the fundamental form-generating processes in architecture, considering architecture as a form of artificial life, and proposing a genetic representation in a form of DNA-like code-script, which can then be subject to developmental and evolutionary processes in response to the user and the environment. The aim of an evolutionary architecture is to achieve in the built environment the symbiotic behaviour and metabolic balance found in the natural environment. To do so, it operates like an organism, in a direct analogy with the underlying design process of nature. The book also proposes a fundamental change in practice The role of the architect here, I think, is not so much to design a building or city as to catalyse them: to act that they may evolve. Gordon Pask in his foreword to the book. The exhibition accompanying the launch of the book was unique in not only having a virtual version available on the internet, but also in achieving the first ever online virtual interaction with the development of an evolving form in a remote exhibition. A model of the system, called the Interactivator, allowed both virtual and actual visitors to make selections or propose (via a bank of switches) genetic information to influence the evolution of the form. The development of specific instances of the form was also influenced by the physical environment of the exhibition space, as detected by data from sensors of temperature, humidity, noise, smoke level and so forth. The Interactivator could also reproduce itself by allowing the program of the model to be downloaded to remote sites. As it replicated itself each replication took on a divergent evolutionary path, the results of which could also be fed back to the central model to contribute to the gene pool. The internet experiment was made possible by the generosity of Ellipsis publishers who hosted the website. Parts of this site can still be visited at Following the exhibition the unit went on to demonstrate the application of this thinking to city planning in Groningen in collaboration with Chris Moller of S333. The influence of the work of Diploma Unit 11 can still be seen in many areas of the AA School. The book received excellent reviews, is 5 star rated on the Amazon US website, and has been widely commented upon in books, lectures and scientific papers. It is now regarded as a seminal work.

However most sandbox-style games situated in cities, do not allow players to wander into buildings. In past research, space planning techniques have already been utilized to generate suitable layouts for both building floor plans and room layouts. We introduce a novel rule-based layout solving approach, especially suited for use in conjunction with procedural generation methods. We show how this solving approach can be used for procedural generation by providing the solver with a userdefined plan. In this plan, users can specify objects to be placed as instances of classes, which in turn contain rules about how instances should be placed. This approach gives us the opportunity to use our generic solver in different procedural generation scenarios. In this paper, we will illustrate mainly with interior generation examples.},

abstract = {Hundreds of millions of people play computer games every day. For them, game content—from 3D objects to abstract puzzles— plays a major entertainment role. Manual labor has so far ensured that the quality and quantity of game content matched the demands of the playing community, but is facing new scalability challenges due to the exponential growth over the last decade of both the gamer population and the production costs. Procedural Content Generation for Games (PCG-G) may address these challenges by automating, or aiding in, game content generation. PCG-G is difﬁcult, since the generator has to create the content, satisfy constraints imposed by the artist, and return interesting instances for gamers. Despite a large body of research focusing on PCG-G, particularly over the past decade, ours is the ﬁrst comprehensive survey of the ﬁeld of PCG-G. We ﬁrst introduce a comprehensive, six-layered taxonomy of game content: bits, space, systems, scenarios, design, and derived. Second, we survey the methods used across the whole ﬁeld of PCG-G from a large research body. Third, we map PCG-G methods to game content layers; it turns out that many of the methods used to generate game content from one layer can be used to generate content from another. We also survey the use of methods in practice, that is, in commercial or prototype games. Fourth and last, we discuss several directions for future research in PCG-G, which we believe deserve close attention in the near future.},

abstract = {Summary Due to its complexity, the evolution of cities is something that is difficult to predict and planning new developments for cities is therefore a difficult task. This complexity can be identified on two levels: on a micro level, it emerges from the multiple relations between the many components and actors in cities, whereas on a macro level it stems from the geographical, social and economic relations between cities. However, many of these relations can be measured. The design of plans for cities can only be improved if designers are able to address measurements of some of the relationships between the components of cities during the design process. These measurements are called urban indicators. By calculating such measurements, designers can grasp the meaning of the changes being proposed, not just as simple alternative layouts, but also in terms of the changes in indicators adding a qualitative perception. This thesis presents a method and a set of tools to generate alternative solutions for an urban context. The method proposes the use of a combined set of design patterns encoding typical design moves used by urban designers. The combination of patterns generates different layouts which can be adjusted by manipulating several parameters in relation to updated urban indicators. The patterns were developed from observation of typical urban design procedures, first encoded as discursive grammars and later translated into parametric design patterns. The CItyMaker method and tools allows the designer to compose a design solution from a set of programmatic premises and fine-tune it by pulling parameters whilst checking the changes in urban indicators. These tools improve the designer's awareness of the consequences of their design moves.},

abstract = {In view of current developments in the theory and technology of digital design, potential novel directions for environments that support performance-based design are beginning to emerge.The field of performance-based design is defined through an analysis of current work in the field.Various models of performance-based architectural design are presented and discussed. On the basis of this analysis, key concepts and issues in the application of performance- based design in architecture are defined and certain research directions for the development of new approaches are presented. Finally we propose a new approach termed: Performative Design. Performative Design suggests that in creating simulation environments for performance-based architectural design both generative and evaluative capabilities can be integrated within performance-based simulations. The potential of performance-based simulation as a model of performance-based design is explored through a case study from an experimental digital design studio. Implication of this work on future research directions in the field is explicated.},

abstract = {The research aims at developing a digital environment for understanding and analyzing natural forces and designing according to the simultaneous feedback given by computational tools. The thesis is an investigation into the concept of interactivity between the designer and computer through the use of computational fluid dynamic tools in a local context of Eastern Netherlands Coast, in response to the already dynamic natural fluid like elements such as air, coastal currents and sand particles. The behavior of these natural elements and forces is significantly dynamic and adaptive to the environment, aspects that can be represented in computer based design environments; hence, the research focuses on the usage of these interactive tools in order to analyze and design. The main problematic developed is to find an alternative solution to the ongoing struggle between Netherlands' coast and North Sea, by creating sand gathering zones in the sea and using these congregated sand surfaces and directed currents as a basis for architectural development. In the scope of the thesis, an exploration of morphogenetic processes in the organic or inorganic development of form is discussed through historical, theoretical and philosophical approaches.},

abstract = {In architecture, design begins by generating ideas and continues by transforming them to concrete spatial formations. Architects learn about the design problem by creating alternatives and testing them in order to gain desired spatial formations. A comprehensive architectural knowledge helps architects in this process. This knowledge is a synthesis of practice and theory, in other words mystery and certainty, intuition and science, experience and research. Architects must proceed in two ways and bring all components together in a creative way. This paper aims to explore contribution of a scientific, and research based approach, namely space syntax, in the design process. Space syntax is based on configurational theory of space and attempts to decode spatial formations and their impacts on human activity. By the development of new techniques for representing and analysing space, space syntax appears as a tool for architects to explore their design ideas and understand possible effects of their proposals. By illustrating a link between research and design, this study attempts to create new horizons for those professionals in architectural practice as well as academics in architectural education.},

abstract = {In Shape, George Stiny argues that seeing shapes -- with all their changeability and ambiguity -- is an inexhaustible source of creative ideas. Understanding shapes, he says, is a useful way to understand what is possible in design.Shapes are devices for visual expression just as symbols are devices for verbal expression. Stiny develops a unified scheme that includes both visual expression with shapes and verbal expression with signs. The relationships -- and equivalencies -- between the two kinds of expressive devices make design comparable to other professional practices that rely more on verbal than visual expression. Design uses shapes while business, engineering, law, mathematics, and philosophy turn mainly to symbols, but the difference, says Stiny, isn't categorical. Designing is a way of thinking. Designing, Stiny argues, is calculating with shapes, calculating without equations and numbers but still according to rules. Stiny shows that the mechanical process of calculation is actually a creative process when you calculate with shapes -- when you can reason with your eyes, when you learn to see instead of count.The book takes the idea of design as calculation from mere heuristic or metaphor to a rigorous relationship in which design and calculation each inform and enhance the other. Stiny first demonstrates how seeing and counting differ when you use rules -- that is, what it means to calculate with your eyes -- then shows how to calculate with shapes, providing formal details. He gives practical applications in design with specific visual examples. The book is extraordinarily visual, with many drawings throughout -- drawings punctuated with words. You have to see this book in order to read it.},

This unique volume challenges the reader to tackle all these complex questions and more.Algorithmic Architecture is not a typical theory-based architectural book; it is not a computer programming or language tutorial book either. It contains a series of provocative design projects, and yet it is not just a design or graphic art book per se. Following the tradition of architecture as a conglomeration of various design fields - engineering, theory, art, and recently, computation - the challenge of this book is to present a concept that, like architecture, is a unifying theme for many diverse disciplines. An algorithm is not only a step-by-step problem-solving procedure, a series of lines of computer codes or a mechanistic linguistic expression, but is also an ontological construct with deep philosophical, social, design, and artistic repercussions. Consequently, this book presents many, various and often seemingly disparate points of view that lead to the establishment of one common theme; algorithmic architecture. Guides readers in the increasingly popular practice of using algorithms to solve complex design issues Demonstrates a technique used by many of the big name architecture firms, now cascading down to educational level Shows architects how to use algorithms to go beyond the mouse and transcend the factory set limitations of current 3D CAD software},

With the tremendous improvement in computer technology, CAD systems as well enhanced their functions and capabilities for designers to extend their imagination and creativity through different ways. However, most recent commercial software is developed for designers to quickly reproduce their design result, or analyze elements of their developing projects. Designers still spend a great amount of time solving design problems, which include site analysis, space planning, and architectural form study, known as "schematic design".$\backslash$nIn spite of this software development trend, some researchers have been commonly interested in exploring the possibilities of space-planning technology during the last thirty years. These researchers have focused on finding the optimized result of space-planning from different aspects of efficiency, methodologies, and considering different kind of data. The results of this research demonstrated the ability of computer calculation to generate workable results, to present two-dimensional space adjacency diagrams or stacking plans that suggest optimized space layouts.$\backslash$nTo utilize the research of space planning optimization and three dimensional form studies, the author developed a solution that proposing three dimensional architectural forms from optimized space layout or preferential alteration by architects. This development includes the research and analysis of design method and space planning procedures, space bubble diagram representations for space adjacencies, spatial dynamic behaviors, and three dimensional architectural form generations, which is named Space Planning Design Advisor (SPDA) system.$\backslash$nExtensive evaluations for the SPDA system and interviews were conducted by the author to practice architects and interior designers. Throughout the process, the author recognized the space of improvements in SPDA from designers' stand of points, and collected the suggestions regarding future developments of SPDA.$\backslash$nIn the conclusion, the author listed the achievement of the research and SPDA development, several potential research topics and developments that based on SPDA system are listed as well. In addition, the author discovered during the interviews that the SPDA can be beneficial to architectural programming students to visually recognize the spatial relationships, as well as inexperienced architects. Furthermore, it offers the experienced architects or interior designers to discover new design concept or space layout.},

In this report, we survey some of the shape grammar papers, present some projects using shape grammars, and give our evaluation of shape grammars in computer graphics. In particular, we feel shape grammars are useful for generating a large variety of buildings, such as might be needed in computer games or animations, and that they could also be useful in design for exploring a large number of similar variations. However, we feel they are less useful for the design of new buildings or modeling of existing buildings. 1},

Belirli bir zaman periyoduna, kişiye veya y{\"{o}}reye {\"{o}}zg{\"{u}} mimarlık {\"{u}}r{\"{u}}nlerini bi{\c{c}}im grameri kapsamında ele alan {\c{c}}alışmalar 1980'li yıllarda hız kazanmıştır. Palladio Villaları, Frank Lloyd Wright'ın Kır evleri, Queen Anne Evleri, Malagueira Evleri ve Klasik Osmanlı Camileri {\"{u}}zerine yapılmış incelemeler bi{\c{c}}im grameri {\c{c}}alışmalarına {\"{o}}rnek g{\"{o}}sterilebilir. Bu bağlamda, 1996 yılında Prof. Dr. G{\"{u}}len {\c{C}}ağdaş, Sedat Hakkı Eldem'in plan tipi sınıflandırmasını temel alarak, Geleneksel T{\"{u}}rk Evleri'nin ana yaşam katlarının planlarını oluşturabilen iki boyutlu parametrik bir bi{\c{c}}im grameri geliştirmiştir. Bu tez {\c{c}}alışmasında, {\c{C}}ağdaş tarafından Geleneksel T{\"{u}}rk Evleri'nin bi{\c{c}}im grameri {\"{u}}zerine yapılan {\c{c}}alışma temel alınarak, Geleneksel T{\"{u}}rk Evleri'yle benzer {\"{o}}zellik g{\"{o}}steren Amasya Yalıboyu Evleri'nin genel {\"{o}}zellikleri, planları ve cepheleri analiz edilmekte, bu analizler sonucunda evlerde g{\"{o}}r{\"{u}}len genel ve {\"{o}}zel durumlar i{\c{c}}in yeni kural ve kural setleri ortaya konulmaktadır. 1. b{\"{o}}l{\"{u}}mde {\c{c}}alışmanın ama{\c{c}}, kapsam ve y{\"{o}}ntemi a{\c{c}}ıklanmaktadır. 2. b{\"{o}}l{\"{u}}mde, y{\"{o}}resel mimari kavramı, y{\"{o}}resel yerleşmeler ve y{\"{o}}resel sivil mimariler başlıkları altında incelenmiştir. Y{\"{o}}resel sivil mimari {\"{o}}rneği olan T{\"{u}}rk Evleri'nin genel {\"{o}}zellikleri anlatıldıktan sonra T{\"{u}}rk Evleri'nde katlar, plan elemanları ve plan tipleriyle ilgili detaylı bilgi verilmektedir. 3. b{\"{o}}l{\"{u}}mde alan {\c{c}}alışmasının ger{\c{c}}ekleştiği, Amasya kentinin genel ve mekansal analizi yapıldıktan sonra, kenti dokusunu oluşturan mimari bileşenlerden {\"{o}}rnekler verilmektedir.

abstract = {This paper presents various applications of evolutionary computing approach for architectural space planning problem. As such the problem of architectural space planning is NP-complete. Finding an optimal solution within a reasonable amount of time for these problems is impossible. However for architectural space planning problem we may not be even looking for an optimal but some feasible solution based on varied parameters. Many different computing approaches for space planning like procedural algorithms, heuristic search based methods, genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic, and artificial neural networks etc. have been developed and are being employed. In recent years evolutionary computation approaches have been applied to a wide variety of applications as it has the advantage of giving reasonably acceptable solution in a reasonable amount of time. There are also hybrid systems such as neural network and fuzzy logic which incorporates the features of evolutionary computing paradigm. The present paper aims to compare the various aspects and merits/demerits of each of these methods developed so far. Sixteen papers have been reviewed and compared on various parameters such as input features, output produced, set of constraints, scope of space coverage-single floor, multi-floor and urban spaces. Recent publications emphasized on energy aspect as well. The paper will help the better understanding of the Evolutionary computing perspective of solving architectural space planning problem. The findings of this paper provide useful insight into current developments and are beneficial for those who look for automating architectural space planning task within given design constraints.},

abstract = {The way in which computers are used is important in the theory, philosophy and practice of architecture. Architects are already using computers to construct complex three dimensional geometric models of their buildings and are beginning to analyse these models using environmental and structural software, a development which raises new questions about the role of architects and engineers. This dissertation puts forward the hypothesis that architects will at times need to be actively involved in computer programming by writing or modifying software. The hypothesis is based on the assumption that the form of a building and its spatial configuration are influenced by the nature of the design process itself. If architects are to have a complete and subtle control over design and to identify their own personal aesthetic language, they must also have control over the design process including the way computer software tools are developed and used. The hypothesis is tested using the example of a ferry terminal, a building type whose function is largely dominated by passenger circulation. Even thought passengers have a very straightforward aim to reach their final destination, the rules governing the way passengers move around the building are complex and a single computer program will not be able to cover all possible aspects of such behaviour. Thus, architects must have the freedom to formulate different rules and study the effects they have on their design. This particularly applies in non-emergency situations when each individual moves inside the building according to different needs and desires. A program was written which runs in real time so that the architect can see the effect of changing the parameters that control the process. The program can be used as evaluation mechanism to study the performance of postulated design or it can be use as creative mechanism where the design may emerge out of the process in the same way that animals create paths in the woods. Either way, the general aim is to optimize the design according to criteria over which the architect, again, must have complete control.},

Outcomes from a practice survey and observations from design studios are used to inform the development of mixed reality (MixR) technology, to enable the applications to reflect architecture specific modes of design praxis. We propose two approaches - studio MixR and site MixR - reflecting the distinction between typical studio based design process and the requirements of a formal design review by the design team and stakeholders. Prototype applications have been implemented and a number of projects have been undertaken to illustrate some of the potential of mixed reality for architecture and urban design. These focus on the early stages of design, from the abstraction of parametric design to on site design reviews undertaken with augmented reality visualization.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the issues of designing architectural skins that can be physically morphed to adapt to changing needs. To achieve this architectural vision, designers have focused on developing mechanical joints, components, and systems for actuation and kinetic transformation. However, the unexplored approach of using lightweight elastic form-changing materials provides an opportunity for designing responsive architectural skins and skeletons with fewer mechanical operations. This research aims to develop elastic modular systems that can be applied as a second skin or brise-soleil to existing buildings.The use of the second skin has the potential to allow existing buildings to perform better in various climatic conditions and to provide a visually compelling skin. This approach is evaluated through three design experiments with prototypes, namely Tent, Curtain and Blind , to serve two fundamental purposes: Comfort and Communication. These experimental prototypes explore the use of digital and physical computation embedded in form-changing materials to design architectural morphing skins that manipulate sunlight and act as responsive shading devices.},

abstract = {This paper investigates conceptual modeling of circulation in settlements using agent-based systems. It explains and compares two different types of model that highlight diametrically opposed architectural tasks in respect to movement. While the first model explores the case where the agents' movement defines the circulation, the latter builds towards the argument that good circulation can be achieved via self-organization within the agent colony. The first type of computational model generates networks that are directly informed by the acts of movement and circulation is a direct result of agents interacting with their environment. Circulation in the second model is seen as an integral part of the morphogenesis of the settlement geometry. The two models help drawing the distinction between two different notions of agency in design. On one hand agency is seen as a group of actors that organizes and modifies the design solutions or its representations. On the other hand, the configuration and structure of agency becomes a design solution per se.},

The possibilities of customization and parameterization offered by the user-friendly interfaces of advanced building-performance simulation software and digital design tools have now enabled architects to carry out performance-based design explorations without the help of simulation experts. This paper presents a customized workflow methodology to explore design alternatives for producing shading devices that can optimize daylight, while blocking out excessive solar heat gains, in an office building in a hot and humid climate. The design alternatives were generated by evolutionary algorithms in accordance with daylight performance requirements and simulated to assess their shading and daylight efficiencies.},

abstract = {The Old Library of Trinity College Dublin, built in 1732, is an internationally renowned research library. In recent decades it has also become a major tourist attraction in Dublin, with the display of the Book of Kells within the Old Library now drawing over half a million visitors per year. The Preservation and Conservation Department of the Library has raised concerns about the impact of the environment on the collection. The location of the building in the city centre, large visitor numbers, and the conditions within the building are putting the collection at risk. In developing a strategic plan to find solutions to these problems, the department has been assessing and documenting the current situation. This paper introduces ongoing work on a system to visualise the collected data, which includes: dust levels and dispersion, internal and external temperature and relative humidity levels, and visitor numbers in the Old Library. We are developing a user interface for which the data, originally stored in various file formats, is consolidated in a database which can be explored using a 3D virtual reconstruction of the Old Library. With this novel technique, it is also possible to compare and assess the relationships between the various datasets in context.},

The grammar is based on the corpus of thirty-five houses designed between 1977 and 1996. The generation of houses in the grammar proceeds by the recursive dissection of rectangles locating four different functional zones (patio, living, services, and sleeping) and the key placement of the staircase. The schematic generations of two existing houses and the detailed generation of a novel one illustrate the grammar.},

abstract = {Wayfinding is a kind of spatial riddle that people encounter almost daily. Although it has been well documented that wayfinding elements--namely, environmental cues, people and time--significantly influence wayfinding, there has been little work done to examine the effectiveness of those influences. In particular, the notion of wayfindingly manageable environment is investigated in the dissertation. A wayfinding task is termed as manageable, whenever a way-seeker successfully navigates the task. When a significant number of wayfinding tasks in an environment are determined to be wayfindingly manageable, the whole environment can be claimed as wayfindingly manageable. "How cues are arranged so that an environment becomes wayfindingly manageable?" is the main research problem considered in the dissertation. This is illustrated through a consecutive three-step development process of theory, visualization and simulation, which looks at the issue from both environment-centered and people-centered perspectives. The first step, engages in the environment-centered perspective, in developing a measure for calculating manageability for wayfinding, expressed in terms of variables at the level of decision points, pair of decision points, routes, tasks and environment, through a paper-based experiment and statistical analyses. The second step is to develop a visualization/simulation approach to apply the criterion of wayfinding manageability considered from both environment-and people-centered views. As a first pass, the measure of manageability developed in the first step is employed in the visualization to explore the issue at the environment-centered level. From the people-centered view, an agent-based modeling simulation is considered in which people-agents are have settings for wayfinding strategies for different wayfinding tasks and associated with time-based benchmarks. Wayfinding-decision processes involving people-agents, namely, wayfinding strategies and time-based benchmarks are retrieved from a computer-based experiment and statistical analyses. The last step in the development process is implementing an agent-based modeling application in which environmental cues are behavior-control agents, and way-seekers are rule-based people agents. Both one-way passive and two-way interactive environmental cues are captured in the application. Different wayfinding tasks for a single environment with different settings for sign-placement are used as proof of concept for demonstrating wayfinding manageability. The ultimate goal, of course, is for this agent-based modeling application to be a design tool for navigable environments through generative manipulation of wayfinding elements, mostly, environmental cues. This dissertation, developed from studies in psychology, is an attempt to make an original contribution to our understanding of the design of wayfindingly navigable environments, in particular, in architecture and environmental graphic design. The methodology comprising experiments, analyses, visualization, and simulation employed in this dissertation is expected to be applicable to other behavior related studies in the fields of design, architecture and psychology.

Among other advantages, its data compression and the potential to generate a large variety of detailed content with reduced human intervention, have made procedural modelling attractive for creating virtual environments increasingly used in movies, games and simulations. We survey procedural methods that are useful to generate features of virtual worlds, including terrains, vegetation, rivers, roads, buildings and entire cities. In this survey, we focus particularly on the degree of intuitive control and of interactivity offered by each procedural method, because these properties are instrumental for their typical users: designers and artists. We identify the most promising research results that have been recently achieved, but we also realize that there is far from widespread acceptance of procedural methods among non-technical, creative professionals. We conclude by discussing some of the most important challenges of procedural modelling.},

Every urban area has a transportation network that follows population and environmental influences, and often a superimposed pattern plan. The buildings appearances follow historical, aesthetic and statutory rules. To create a virtual city, a roadmap has to be designed and a large number of buildings need to be generated. We propose a system using a procedural approach based on L-systems to model cities. From various image maps given as input, such as land-water boundaries and population density, our system generates a system of highways and streets, divides the land into lots, and creates the appropriate geometry for the buildings on the respective allotments. For the creation of a city street map, L-systems have been extended with methods that allow the consideration of global goals and local constraints and reduce the complexity of the production rules. An L-system that generates geometry and a texturing system based on texture elements and procedural methods compose the buildings.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully.

abstract = {This study investigated the ability of bacteriocins isolated from Bacillus spp. (Bacillus species) to inhibit four different yeast isolates obtained from common food products (nono, yoghurt, ogi and cheese) commonly consumed by Nigerians with minimal heat treatment. Forty-five Bacillus spp. was isolated and identified from common food products using cultural, morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics. These isolates were tested for antimicrobial activity against Salmonella enteritidis (3), Micrococcus luteus (1) and Staphylococcus aureus (2). Eight bacteriocin producing strains were identified from an over- night broth culture centrifugated at 3500 revolutions for five minutes. Fungicidal effects of these bacteriocins were tested against four yeast strains using the Agar Well Diffusion method. The bacteriocins produced wide zones of inhibition ranging from 5.9±0.000 to 24.00±0.000 mm against the 4 yeast strains tested. There was a significant difference (at p{\textless}0.05) between the yeast organisms and the bacteriocins from the Bacillus spp. The study reveals the antifungal property of bacteriocins from Bacillus spp. and serves therefore as a base for further studies in its use in the control of diseases and extension of shelf-life of products prone to fungi contamination.},

abstract = {This research discusses the intermediate space that lies between private and public space, as well as its definition and importance in space configuration regarding urban morphology and social relations. It investigates how the organisation of in-?‐between space affects social interaction in different urban patterns. As many researchers caution, terms such as semi-?‐private and semi-?‐ public can be deceptive in attempting to define the relationship between the building and the street, because of the overlapping territory of this space. Therefore in this study the in-?‐between space concept is used to portray this space and the interrelations that take place. Modernist urban space has changed the spatial relations between the building and the street. Previous research (Gehl, 1996) has revealed that the organisation of space between buildings has an important impact in terms of social interaction. Through organising these thresholds and giving the possibility of forming social activities, people have the chance to encounter more frequently and develop friendships. Thus this study also examines whether modern environments can develop a sense of community and neighbouring compared to traditional neighbourhoods by their spatial configuration and broken relation between the building and the street. This research adopts a mixed method approach to understand the complex relations and socio-?‐spatial structure of the city. It utilises various methods through focusing on three dissimilar urban patterns in Izmir, Turkey, which developed in different periods. Two neighbourhoods with a traditional street pattern and one modern housing unit of middle-?‐ and high-?‐income groups are compared through using space syntax analysis, snapshot observations, questionnaires, focus groups and interviews.

abstract = {Designing virtual game worlds is often a long and labor- intensive process. Moreover, when a game world needs to be slightly altered in appearance, the entire process needs to be repeated, or will at least require some repetitious tasks. Ideally, when the same game world is needed under different circumstances (e.g. in another season, before and after a war, in prosperous or poor economic conditions), the designer should be aided in this process using procedural generation techniques. We propose an approach for the specification of procedural filters that describe how (parts of) virtual worlds should be customized to fit a particular situation based on their semantics and the conditions of the situation. This descrip- tion will guide the customization process by triggering and parametrizing, among others, procedural instructions that can change the appearance of the virtual world. We will discuss how the generic nature of this approach, which fa- vors reusability, and its integration with semantics, which increases the intuitiveness of the design process, can elim- inate many of the repetitious tasks involved in performing these actions manually. We describe an implementation of this approach that shows how some simple procedural filters can i) age an urban envi- ronment and simulate the effects of poor living conditions on the look of that environment, and ii) apply a party atmo- sphere to an ordinary office scene.},

abstract = {Integrating daylight and energy performance with optimization into the design process has always been a challenge for designers. Most of the building environmental performance simulation tools require a considerable amount of time and iterations for achieving accurate results. Moreover the combination of daylight and energy performances has always been an issue, as different software packages are needed to perform detailed calculations. A simplified method to overcome both issues using recent advances in software integration is explored here. As a case study; the optimization of external shadings in a typical office space in Australia is presented. Results are compared against common solutions adopted as industry standard practices. Visual comfort and energy efficiency are analysed in an integrated approach. The DIVA (Design, Iterate, Validate and Adapt) plug-in for Rhinoceros/Grasshopper software is used as the main tool, given its ability to effectively calculate daylight metrics (using the Radiance/Daysim engine) and energy consumption (using the EnergyPlus engine). The optimization process is carried out parametrically controlling the shadings' geometries. Genetic Algorithms (GA) embedded in the evolutionary solver Galapagos are adopted in order to achieve close to optimum results by controlling iteration parameters. The optimized result, in comparison with conventional design techniques, reveals significant enhancement of comfort levels and energy efficiency. Benefits and drawbacks of the proposed strategy are then discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

In order to assess the environmental, social, and architectural opportunities that are increasing with responsive building envelopes, new tools are needed to simulate their multi-performance capabilities. This paper describes a computational design framework to support human interaction with environmentally-responsive electroactive dynamic daylighting systems. The objective is to develop algorithms for variable solar control and visible transmittance that simultaneously address occupant preferences for visual effects and interaction. Results demonstrate that energy performance and user satisfaction are not mutually exclusive and can be co-optimized. The effectiveness and limitations of the computational framework in assessing strategies to balance environmental performance and human interaction are discussed. Conclusions present areas of ongoing work that integrate multi-user interactions and immersive visualization techniques with multiscalar energy modeling tools.},

This paper, in this framework will be presenting a design research studio that aims at developing the relational thinking capabilities in computational design process. In this studio, topics of parametric design, parametric modelling and relationality was questioned through design process. In 2006-2007 spring semester in the Graduate Studio II course of Computational Design Program at Yildiz Technical University, parametric modelling software, GenerativeComponents, was introduced to question the pros and cons of parametric design in architecture. In this software there are no ready-made geometric primitives or shapes. Point is the only ready-made drawing element to use. A geometric shape is constructed by associating elements with each other. Each geometric association can be done through a number of commands with different parameters. The end-product is a parameter-based entity. Parameters can be changed easily, which in turn changes the whole geometric shape. In this design research studio held by 10 students, the topics of parametric design and associative thinking are questioned to explore their effect on the practices of architectural design and education.},

The constant development in computer technologies has been improving visualization and interpretation techniques for virtual reconstructions of no longer extant or inaccessible sites. Reconstruction projects of vanished heritage sites implement various approaches because of different challenges at each site. This research involves 3D reconstructions, as well as historical research of early nineteenth century residences, Radcliffe-King and Gabriel Manigault houses in the Ansonborough neighborhood of Charleston, South Carolina, USA. The demolition of these two mansions in the first half of the twentieth century leads to the loss of the residential character at the intersection of George and Meeting Streets in Ansonborough. Photogrammetry and rectification techniques established the dimensions and the scale for these buildings from salvaged architectural details and early photographs to recreate the lost residential character. Other sources, like maps and drawings are used to supplement the photographs and salvaged materials for virtual reconstruction.},

abstract = {This thesis proposes a model of understanding the constraining effect of floorplates on the integration of office layouts. The proposed model is based on the analysis of floorplates and layouts which is simultaneously configurational, global and robust. The study departs from two observations: first, there is a difference between the lifespan of shells and layouts; second, shells influence but do not determine the layouts than can be accommodated in them. The thesis proposes two descriptions of shape which gauge their compactness and convex fragmentation based on configurational relations among modular units of shape. Shapes of actual floorplates are described according to the proposed measures leading to a typology of office buildings. The space syntax research on workspaces has demonstrated that the integration of layout circulation affects the patterns of movement, encounter and interaction, which are linked to organizational performance. Actual layouts are described according to skewness and density of connectivity of linear maps leading to three alternative types of office layouts: sparse grids, dense grids and fishbones. Two ideal layouts of grids and fishbones, extracted from the typology, reflect opposing ways of increasing the layout integration and best represent open-plan layouts. Experiments with hypothetical grids and fishbones generated systematically on theoretical shapes demonstrate strong but differing effects of shape on layout integration. These are subsequently confirmed by the analysis of hypothetical grids and fishbones generated into a large sample of actual office buildings in the US. The relationship between floorplate shape and layout is mediated by the generative principle applied to the generation of layout. There exists an underlying congruence between a morphological typology of layouts (which distinguishes between fishbone and grid as alternative principles for increasing integration) and a morphological typology of shapes (which distinguishes between more compact and convexly unified shapes and shapes with wings). The findings highlight the distinction between constraint and determination. underlying constraints upon the layout integration but they do not determine it. Floorplate shapes exercise The proposed model enhances the evaluation of existing building portfolios for their suitability for different types of office layouts and aids the design and planning of new work environments.},

abstract = {Existence of light reveals the architectural space. And images depict them. This thesis proposes a computational model for evaluating tonal and compositional qualities of photorealistically rendered synthetic images. Its aim is to assist the architects to quickly externalize their spatial imagination through automated evaluation and selection of volume rendered images in search of the ones they like to achieve. Taking the visual perception as the focal communication tool in design, the research promotes the use of computer generated realistic images to the very beginning of the design process. The implemented tool, Narration of Llgbt; is a plug-in that runs on the 3D Studio Max 7 environment, where realistic images can be rendered without any evaluation for the generated images. The tool aims to create a more self-conscious rendering environment that would computationally recognize the qualities of image by reading it via bitmap values. The plug-in, while trying to determine the user's intention regarding the tonal distribution of light via any kind of user selected images, it also embeds algorithms of established photographical composition techniques to evaluate and classify the generated images. In the awareness of the strong relationship between space, light and images, this research intends to offer an alternative image-driven design process as well as going into the experimentation of evaluating the quality of images with computational means.},

It involves building a computational model consisting of agents, each of which represents an actor in the social world, and an 'environment' in which the agents act. Agents are able to interact with each other and are programmed to be pro-active, autonomous and able to perceive their virtual world. The techniques of ABM are derived from artificial intelligence and computer science, but are now being developed independently in research centers throughout the world. In Agent-Based Models, Nigel Gilbert reviews a range of examples of agent-based modeling, describes how to design and build your own models, and considers practical issues such as verification, validation, planning a modeling project, and how to structure a scholarly article reporting the results of agent-based modeling. It includes a glossary, an annotated list of resources, advice on which programming environment to use when creating agent-based models, and a worked, step-by-step example of the development of an ABM.},

@phdthesis{Davis2013,
abstract = {In this thesis I consider the relationship between the design of software and the design of flexible parametric models. There is growing evidence that parametric models employed in practice lack the flexibility to accommodate certain design changes. When a designer attempts to change a model's geometry (by modifying the model's underlying functions and parameters) they occasionally end up breaking the model. The designer is then left with a dilemma: spend time building a new model, or abandon the changes and revise the old model. Similar dilemmas exist in software engineering. Despite these shared concerns, Robert Woodbury (2010, 66) states that there is currently “little explicit connection” between the practice of software engineering and the practice of parametric modelling. In this thesis I consider, using a reflective practice methodology, how software engineering may inform parametric modelling. Across three case studies I take aspects of the software engineering body of knowledge (language paradigms; structured programming; and interactive programming) and apply them to the design of parametric models for the Sagrada Fam{\'{i}}lia, the Dermoid pavilion, and the Responsive Acoustic Surface. In doing so I establish three new parametric modelling methods. The contribution of this research is to show there are connections between the practice of software engineering and the practice of parametric modelling. These include the following: • Shared challenges: Both practices involve unexpected changes occurring within the rigid logic of computation. • Shared research methods: Research methods from software engineering apply to the study of parametric modelling. • Shared practices: The software engineering body of knowledge seems to offer a proven pathway for improving the practice of parametric modelling. These connections signal that software engineering is an underrepresented and important precedent for architects using parametric models; a finding that has implications for how parametric modelling is taught, how parametric models are integrated with practice, and for how researchers study and discuss parametric modelling.},

abstract = {The paper presents research on a robotically fabricated acoustic wall system, the so-called “Acoustic Brick Wall”, which functions as an acoustic zoning element for office spaces. Two aims were embedded in this research. First, the investigation of alternate design and fabrication means of manipulating and enhancing the acoustic performance of office spaces through the funda- mental implementation of a powerful but so far rarely recognized phenomenon: sound diffusion. Second, the development of a computational design and fabrication framework that would allow the production of individually adaptable walls in an industrial context. To verify the findings, the fabrication and related acoustic measures of 1:1 prototypes (Figure 1) are discussed},

@phdthesis{Fasoulaki2008a,
abstract = {There are building systems, called “modularized”, in which the component systems (for structure, lighting, etc) can be analyzed and synthesized independently since their performance and design do not interact or affect one another. There are other building systems, called “coupled”, in which the component systems do interact and influence one another. The thesis acknowledges that in a building there are both sub-systems that act independently and others that interact. While many design processes have been proposed for dealing with discrete sub-systems, there is no systematic study for building sub-systems that interrelate. This thesis examines a different design approach called integrated. The term “integrated” has a dual utilization in this study. The first use refers to the integration of form and building performance. The second use refers to the integration of interrelated and diverse building performances involving multiple disciplines. The integrated design approach analyzes and evaluates several interrelated design systems involving different disciplines in the early design phase. The goal of the approach is the generation of design alternatives guided simultaneously by two basic objectives: the aspiration for form exploration and the satisfaction of the performances of interrelated systems. After defining a framework for an integrated design approach, which includes inter-disciplinary collaboration, unified design, optimization, simulation, and other formal and digital techniques, the approach will be demonstrated in a case study. The objective of the case study is to demonstrate that the integrated design approach has validity and can be realized, in this case, for the generation of high-rise buildings guided by structural, lighting, zoning codes, and aesthetic criteria.},

abstract = {Contemporary digital design practice is in a state of rapid evolution. While architects have employed computer-aided drafting (CAD) systems for decades, only recently have two distinct and potent design sensibilities – parametric and algorithmic design – emerged. Nurtured by early architectural researchers and programmers operating in practice, these methodologies are now gaining widespread professional and academic acceptance. However, there remains considerable confusion about the meaning of the two terms, and about the meaning of ‘parametric design' in particular. This article attempts to clarify the situation.},

abstract = {Integrating daylight and energy performance with optimization into the design process has always been a challenge for designers. Most of the building environmental performance simulation tools require a considerable amount of time and iterations for achieving accurate results. Moreover the combination of daylight and energy performances has always been an issue, as different software packages are needed to perform detailed calculations. A simplified method to overcome both issues using recent advances in software integration is explored here. As a case study; the optimization of external shadings in a typical office space in Australia is presented. Results are compared against common solutions adopted as industry standard practices. Visual comfort and energy efficiency are analysed in an integrated approach. The DIVA (Design, Iterate, Validate and Adapt) plug-in for Rhinoceros/Grasshopper software is used as the main tool, given its ability to effectively calculate daylight metrics (using the Radiance/Daysim engine) and energy consumption (using the EnergyPlus engine). The optimization process is carried out parametrically controlling the shadings' geometries. Genetic Algorithms (GA) embedded in the evolutionary solver Galapagos are adopted in order to achieve close to optimum results by controlling iteration parameters. The optimized result, in comparison with conventional design techniques, reveals significant enhancement of comfort levels and energy efficiency. Benefits and drawbacks of the proposed strategy are then discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

The possibilities of customization and parameterization offered by the user-friendly interfaces of advanced building-performance simulation software and digital design tools have now enabled architects to carry out performance-based design explorations without the help of simulation experts. This paper presents a customized workflow methodology to explore design alternatives for producing shading devices that can optimize daylight, while blocking out excessive solar heat gains, in an office building in a hot and humid climate. The design alternatives were generated by evolutionary algorithms in accordance with daylight performance requirements and simulated to assess their shading and daylight efficiencies.},

abstract = {Performance-driven architectural design emphasizes on integrated and comprehensive optimization of various quantifiable performances of buildings. As the leading profession of a project team, architects play a vital role in guiding and conducting the performance-driven design. Methodology and techniques start emerging both in literature and practice. However, architects often find them difficult to use for various reasons. Therefore, developing an effective technique to conduct performance-driven design and optimization from the perspective of architects is necessary. This paper starts from discussing the concept of performance-driven architectural design. Existing methodology and techniques are reviewed. The focus is on selecting a basic platform suitable for architects, upon which the technique can be developed. Rhinoceros, an architectural modeling program, is used, along with its graphical algorithm editor Grasshopper, to establish such technique by incorporating three performance simulation programs, namely Ecotect, Radiance, and EnergyPlus. Design cases are presented to demonstrate the technique and its effectiveness. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
